George Bachich About The Author I am fascinated by accordions and see a great need to rescue the old instruments that have been deteriorating for decades. I get a real boost every time I am able to breathe new life into a neglected old accordion.**** I began repairing my own accordions about eleven years ago. However, as word of that spread, other people in my area began to ask me to help them with their accordions, too. At first I never charged anyone because it was my hobby, I was still learning, and above all, I wanted to help them get their accordions back into action. But eventually, it got to be too much. There was obviously a lot of demand for accordion repair, especially free accordion repair, and I only had so much time, so I began to charge. Word continued to spread and people began to come from farther away. I took on more interesting repair jobs, tuning projects, and some complete rebuilds, and I got pretty good at it. In the process I found myself answering a lot of questions about how accordions work, what goes wrong with them, and what to watch out for when buying a used accordion. A few friends began suggesting that I write a book to share with everyone what I had been sharing with them, and I thought that sounded like fun, so I wrote Piano Accordion Owner's Manual and Buyers Guide for everyone who owns or is considering owning an accordion. To my pleasant surprise, it has received very good reviews, and sales have exceeded my initial expectations. It also appeals to a much wider audience than I had in mind when I wrote it. Although I thought I was writing for a primarily American audience, I have learned that the USA comprises only a tiny portion of the accordion market. Approximately half my sales have been to people in other countries (37 other countries, as of October 23, 2019).

George Bachich, October 23, 2019 Why Accordions? The accordion is the most capable and versatile instrument I know. It can effectively accompany and complement practically any other combination of instruments, it is one of the best solo instruments, it can even be a one man band, and it is portable. The best accordion players inspire us all to try to learn to play like them, but it doesn\u2019t matter if we ever achieve that level, as we can all get plenty of enjoyment out of our accordions at whatever level we play. The accordion is really everyone's instrument. It is easy enough to manage that any of us can learn to play simple, satisfying, beautiful music at home, even if we never intend to perform on stage. Accordions are alive; they breathe, they vibrate warmly on our chest, they generate mood and excitement. Their haunting timbre draws us eagerly into the music. All this makes it hard for me to understand how such a fine instrument could have suffered such an ignominious decline in popularity over the last half of the twentieth century. For cultural reasons, and through no fault of its own, the accordion fell from being a universally accepted multicultural icon to being an embarrassment, and the butt of snide and condescending jokes. Neglected in basements and garages for decades, the millions of accordions produced and sold in the United States between 1935 and 1970 slowly deteriorated, and many died. But that is turning around now. In just about every musical genre, creative artists are rediscovering that the accordion has a proper and meaningful role to play. Accordions appear on stage with the big stars, as well as in music videos and in TV commercials. Accordions are cool again. It's okay to have one now, and to admit that you play. Long dormant accordions are being pulled out of storage and brought to life by long dormant musicians eager to recapture the music of their past. Life-long piano players are discovering the benefits of the accordion's versatility and portability, and are adding accordions to their stable of instruments. Younger generations, unaware of and unaffected by the oh, so yesterday notion that accordions might somehow be uncool, are embracing accordions as they deserve to be embraced. As this modern accordion revival unfolds, the old instruments are being called back into service. They are coming out of the closet and finding their rightful places in living rooms, parks, restaurants, clubs, and even on stage. This new interest in accordions creates a need for information about accordions. Accordion Revival intends to provide it. Because there are so many old accordions that need rescue and currently so few people to rescue them, I am dedicating this website to recruiting the army of rescuers needed. I am happy to know that you are interested in joining that army. My goal is to provide you all the information you need to get the job done.

You don\u2019t need fancy tools or expensive electronic instruments to fix your accordion. A sophisticated super-accurate electronic tuner, once a $300 to $500 item, can now be had for just a few dollars at the iPad/iPhone App Store, assuming you already have an iPad or iPhone (download \"n-Track Tuner Pro\"). But you don't even need that for most repairs. Nearly everything you will need to do can be done with standard tools you can get at the hardware store and a few special tools you can easily make from steel or aluminium rods or in some cases, from hardwood. If you have a hack saw, a bench vice, a bench grinder, a small drill press, a belt sander, and a couple of files, you can make all the special tools you need. The articles posted here on how to make specific types of repairs also include instructions on how to make the required tools. The most important things you need to repair your accordion are motivation, mechanical aptitude, some hand tools, a work table, a little coaching from someone with experience (like me), and good sources for the correct repair materials. Mechanical aptitude is really nothing more than the desire to fix things, the ability to remember or record how they came apart, common sense, and perseverance. The hand tools you need for simple repairs are pretty basic. To get any accordion apart and the reed blocks out, all you need are a screw driver and a pair of pliers (the best kind is a bellows pin pliers that you can make yourself from an inexpensive end-cutter pliers - see the short article below). For the most common repair, changing reed leathers, you will find a normally closed tweezers (the kind you have to squeeze to open) indispensable. You will also need a razor to cut reed leathers to the proper length. Your work table should be big enough to allow you to spread out the three major components of the accordion (treble cabinet, bass cabinet, and bellows) and still have room to work on a reed block or two. Good lighting is essential, and an LED headlight (that straps onto your forehead) is essential for looking into tight places. Your work table should also include a tuning bellows, which you can easily make from an old accordion bellows. See the article on making a test bellows. How to make a bellows pin pliers Modify a pair of cheap end-cutters (pliers with the cutting jaws across the end, rather than along one side) by filing two round holes centered where the two cutting jaws meet. The pliers can be cheap imports because you are ruining the cutting edges anyway. Make one hole about 3/16\" in diameter for large bass pins, and make one 3/32\" in diameter for small pins. I used round files of each size chucked into my drill press, and squeezed the pliers onto the spinning file until I had the hole I wanted. Here is a photo of the pliers I made. Opening the accordion It is best to remove the shoulder straps and the back pad (if any) before opening the accordion. Once that is done, locate and count the bellows pins on the treble side of the bellows. There will usually be three or four on the back and three or four on the front, but there may also be one on the top and one on the bottom. Avoid marring the pins or the plastic finish on the accordion when you pull the pins. If you don't have the special pliers made for this purpose, you can wrap the jaws of any pliers with tape to pad them. Stand the accordion on its feet, that is, with the bass plate and bass strap down. Grip each treble side bellows pin with the pliers and pull it straight out, steadying the accordion with your other hand as you do so. Some accordions have screws in place of the pins, in which case you will spin them out with a screwdriver. Keep the screws and/or pins in order, as they are often not all exactly the same length or diameter, and they should be put back into the same holes they came from. (To keep them in order, I stab them into a Styrofoam block in the same order in which they are to be reinstalled, front pins in the front of the block, rear pins in the rear.) When you have removed all the pins from the treble side of the bellows, try lifting one corner of the treble section off the bellows. You may have to hold the bellows down while you pull up on the treble section. If you meet significant resistance, check for any bellows strap or snap mounting screws within a half inch of the bellows that might be penetrating the bellows frame and remove them also. Forcing the accordion apart while any screw or pin still penetrates the bellows frame can damage the bellows frame, necessitating a costly repair. In lieu of bellows pins, some aluminum bodied Hohner accordions have two lever latches under the treble grille that release the treble side from the bellows. On those models, remove the grille, rotate the levers 180 degrees, and lift the front of the treble cabinet off the bellows, then disengage the hinge clips at the back. Do not remove the screws along the back. To separate the bellows from the bass side of these accordions, first remove the bass cover, then release the two thumb clips and remove the bass machine and bass button board as an assembly, and finally, remove the five screws that fasten the bass cabinet to the bellows. The bass cabinet can the be lifted free of the bellows. When the treble section first separates from the bellows, peek inside to see if any internal microphone wires must be disconnected before lifting it far enough to tear those wires loose from their mounting, which is often very fragile. Once the wires are unplugged, turn the treble section over and set it on the table with the reed blocks facing upward. Now you can inspect for bad leathers, cracked wax, missing reeds, loose reed blocks, etc. If your accordion has no tone chamber, the treble side will look something like this: If it has a tone chamber, it will look like this: The bass side, with the bellows attached, looks like this: For better access to the bass reed blocks, remove the bellows from the bass section as well, but not before noting how it goes back together. If there are four bellows pins on the front of the bass section and three on the back, then it will be obvious which way the bellows goes back on. If it is not obvious, then mark the bellows frame with a pencil so you can be sure to put it back in the correct orientation, or the bellows frame will not seal and your bellows pins will not line up. Be sure to unplug any microphone wires before lifting the bellows too far. If you are removing reed blocks, be very careful not to bend the register slides. In many older accordions, the slides are mounted in the reed block rather than in the foundation plate. If this is the case, lifting the reed block without first disengaging the slide from the switch mechanism can cause the slide to kink, rendering it useless. Once bent, they are very difficult or impossible to straighten well enough to work properly. Note the orientation of the reed blocks and the details of the slide\u2019s connection to the linkage so you will be able to put it back exactly the way it came out. When reinstalling any reed block, make sure it is securely and rigidly fastened down so no air can leak under it. When you have finished your interior inspection, set the bellows back onto the bass section (being careful not to snag any bass reed leathers in the process), reconnecting any microphone wires as you go, and install the bass side bellows pins. Then set the treble section in place on the bellows, reconnecting any microphone wires as you go and making sure you have the bass buttons and treble keys all facing forward. Install the bellows pins in their proper holes. If the pins are hard to push in, you can save wear and tear on your fingers by pushing them in with a small block of wood. However, if you have to push very hard, you may have the wrong pin in the wrong hole, or something misaligned. Make sure you have the best fit for all pins before forcing any pin into any hole. Finally, reinstall any bellows strap screws you may have removed, and put on the shoulder straps and back pad. Access to the bass machine is easiest while the treble side is removed from the bellows, because this allows you to set the bass half of the accordion down on its bellows with the bass cover facing up. If you don\u2019t take the treble side off, it is hard to stabilize the accordion in this position unless you use an accordion stand, a simple frame that keeps the accordion from tipping over or sliding away while you remove the bass cover. You can make it out of scrap lumber and a few drywall screws. I used 1 x 1 boards I ripped from some recycled 1 x 4, but you can make yours from just about anything. You might want to pad it with felt, foam rubber, or carpet to help protect the finish on your accordion. Usually, you remove the bass strap by backing off the large knurled nut until that end of the strap comes loose. Many really old accordions have the strap screwed directly to the bass cabinet, in which case you simply remove the screws. Others have a pair of machine screws mounted in the bass cabinet (threaded ends facing upward) that engage holes in the bass strap. In this case, a rectangular washer and small knurled nuts on those machine screws clamp the strap in place, so just remove the nuts and washer. It is usually not necessary to disconnect the other end of the bass strap. Just pull the strap out of your way to get access to the bass cover fasteners. The bass cover is usually held on by four screws near the corners, but sometimes just two screws, top and bottom, and sometimes with some sort of spring clips or sliding pins or push-button releases, and no screws at all. Watch out for very tiny countersunk wood screws along the edges of the bass cover, especially near the center of the front edge. If there are any, you definitely want to remove them before pulling the bass cover off. Once you have the cover off, you can see the bass machine. When you put the bass cover back on, be sure to guide the air release button through its hole in the bass cover before you install any of the screws. Here is a typical bass machine: Why replace old leathers? Proper accordion maintenance includes periodically checking the reed leathers and replacing any not in perfect shape. What is perfect shape, you say? Well, every leather should be soft and pliable and should return to position tight against the reed plate after each use. Reed leathers are small leather check valves mounted on the reed plates. There are two on each reed plate - one on the side facing into the reed block and one on the side facing outward, that is, out into the bellows. Their function is to prevent bellows air from leaking through the reed vents (slots over which the reed tongues are mounted) not in use. Leathers should close under their own power whenever they are not forced open by air coming through the reed vent behind them. When the bellows is expanding (bass section moving outward), the reed tongues on the inside of the reed block are in use, as air is drawn into the accordion through any open note valves. The leathers on the inside of the reed block adjacent to those reed tongues close off the adjacent reed vents to prevent air from leaking into the bellows through those vents and through the reed tongues behind them on the outside of the reed block. When the bellows is being compressed (bass section traveling inward), the air flow is reversed, bringing the reed tongues on the outside face of the reed block into play. In this case the leathers on the outside of the reed block remain closed to prevent air from leaking out past the reed tongues on the inside of the reed block. Air rushing out of the accordion through any open note valves forces the interior leathers on those particular reeds to open, while the higher pressure within the compressing bellows forcefully closes the leathers on the outside of the reed block. If leathers hang open too far, say 1/4 inch or more, they may not close at all, resulting in a significant air leak, and throwing the adjacent reed tongues out of tune. This can make you think your accordion needs tuning, but simply replacing the bad leathers will probably bring it back into tune. If leathers hang open between 1/4 and 1/8 inch, they may eventually close, but only after their adjacent reeds have begun to sound. Those reeds will initially sound out of tune until their leathers close, at which time they will suddenly jump back into tune, resulting in an audible pitch change shortly after the reed begins to sound. Leathers hanging just slightly open, say 1/8 inch or less, will be forced closed by air pressure before the adjacent reeds begin to sound, but not before some air has leaked through the vents they are supposed to seal. This leaking air momentarily relieves the pressure on the adjacent reed tongues, slightly delaying their response. Even though these marginally bad reed leathers may not sound bad, they will sap your accordion's performance, causing your reeds to respond more slowly and causing the accordion to use more air than necessary. To get the best performance out of your accordion, you should keep all the leathers in perfect shape. Some people pay thousands of dollars extra for accordions with handmade reeds because handmade reeds respond just a bit more quickly at low bellows pressures, significantly improving accordion performance. You may be able to get a similar increase in performance for much less money simply by replacing all your bad leathers. How to make a test bellows You can make a simple test bellows from an old accordion bellows and two pieces of plank or plywood. If the bellows frame has already been cut off your old bellows, as would be the case if this bellows had been replaced by a new one, simply cut two pieces of 1/2 inch plywood to fit over each open end of the bellows and glue them on. Make sure your glue joints are air tight. To facilitate anchoring it to your work bench with screws, bolts, or clamps, make these wooden end caps slightly larger than the outside dimensions of the bellows. A one inch margin all around should be sufficient. If your bellows still has its wooden bellows frame attached, as would be the case if the bellows had simply been salvaged from a junk accordion, you can use wood screws to attach your end plates to the bellows frames, then seal the joints with hot reed wax. Alternatively, you can put foam weatherstripping or gasket material between the bellows frame and the end plate before screwing it together. This latter solution makes the most sense if you are going to put weights inside. If you prefer not to anchor the bottom end plate to your work table, you can add enough weight inside to hold it down while you are lifting the top plate to expand the bellows. A couple of bricks or a big box of bolts or a bag of sand placed inside the bellows should do the trick. Make a hole near the center of the top plate approximately the same size as the holes in the bottoms of each chamber in a reed block, about 1/2 inch in diameter. A hole this size will minimize the need to silence adjacent reeds in order to hear just the one you want to test, and is best if you will be using your test bellows just to check the operation of reeds and leathers. However, if you will be tuning, it is essential that the hole in the bottom of the reed block be consistently placed completely over the hole in the top of the test bellows. In that case, a larger, rectangular hole is best. The hole on my tuning bellows (not the one shown below) is 7/16\" wide (parallel to the rail) x 3/4\" long. The drawback to larger holes is that air sometimes feeds to multiple reeds, forcing you to silence all but the one you want to test. Glue a piece of leather to the top plate, fuzzy side up, centered around this hole. You might also choose to fasten a small wooden rail or metal angle about 1/4 inch away from the hole to facilitate properly aligning the reed block over the hole. If you have made a larger rectangular hole, you can place the rail a bit closer, say 1/8\" from the hole. If you scribe index marks on the rail aligned with the edges of the hole, it will be easy to see whether you have it centered. To use the test bellows, place the reed block on the top plate with the hole on the bottom of the reed chamber of the reed you wish to sound aligned with the hole in the top plate. If the hole in the top plate is large enough to also sound the reed on the opposite side of the reed block, you can silence it with a piece of fabric or leather squeezed against it with the fingers of the hand holding the reed block in position. Your other hand will be used to raise and lower one end of the test bellows to force air over the selected reed. When using your test bellows for tuning, be aware that the pressures are reversed relative to those inside the accordion. Compressing the test bellows generates higher pressure air to drive the reed tongue on the inside of the reed block, while on the accordion, the higher pressure air resulting from bellows compression drives the reed tongue on the outside of he reed block. Thus, on the test bellows the inner reed tongue works under higher pressure than the outer one, just the opposite of what occurs inside the accordion. Since the reed frequency is impacted by air density, which is proportional to the pressure, the frequency of both the interior and exterior reeds will be different on the test bellows than they are inside the accordion. Tuning the reeds to their proper frequencies on the test bellows will throw them out of tune in the accordion, where it really matters. The proper use of a test bellows during tuning is therefore limited to making corrections of the magnitude determined while the reed block is in the accordion. That is, if the reed plays three cents too flat in the accordion, you can use the test bellows to determine when you have sharpened it the required three cents. For instance, if on the test bellows the tuner indicates that same reed tongue is one cent too sharp, you can sharpen it until it indicates four cents too sharp, which should put it right on pitch once it is back in the accordion. Your test bellows has many uses other than tuning. You can use it to voice reeds, to find loose reeds, to find silent reeds or to verify that you have successfully cleared them, to observe reed valve (leather) operation, and, in conjunction with your tuner (or your well trained ear) to sound possible replacement reeds to determine whether they produce the note you need. Here are two photos of one I made recently. I used an old bellows cut from an accordion to allow installation of a new bellows, so the old bellows had no frames on it. I glued the bottom of the bellows directly to the bottom board, made a new bellows frame from 1 x 1 lumber, which I glued to the top of the bellows, and screwed the top board to that bellows frame with foam rubber weatherstriping sandwiched in between as an air seal. B**ecause I did not want to screw it down to my work bench, I put a bunch of heavy bolts inside, glued in place to keep them from shifting around, These can also be made without interior weights and mounted under a table, actuated downward by foot pedals and returned upward by springs, but I prefer to have mine on top so I can operate it by hand in order to feel the pressure being applied and get a better sense of how the reed is responding to that pressure. You can use your imagination to build a different design. One of the readers of this website, Chris Krasev of Milton, Ontario, submitted the following photo of an interesting one he built. As you can see, he added moveable rails and air valves made up from register slides salvaged from a junk accordion. Dennis Amott of North Vancouver, Canada, sent me a link to his YouTube video of a tuning bellows he made. If you click the link, you will see that he made a portable table top model that opens downward, so the top plate remains stationary and level as the bellows is opened, allowing it to be operated with just one hand. Never oil your accordion Accordions are big air filters. Lots of air is pumped through them, and the moisture, dust and lint in the air all tend to collect on interior parts, so the air emerges cleaner than it went in. This accumulation of lint in the accordion is inevitable, but oiling any part in the accordion tends to make it even worse. The oil attracts more dust and lint than before, and when enough of it combines with the oil, it makes a thick, gooey substance that can cause keys, bass buttons, and register switches and slides to stick. When you encounter a sticking key, button, switch, or slide, you may be tempted to oil it, but on accordions you should resist that temptation. The better course is to take it apart, clean it thoroughly, determine the source of friction, sand, smooth, polish, realign, or loosen parts as necessary to reduce the friction, and put it back together dry. Although oil may seem to help in the short run, in the long run you will regret using it. If you absolutely must use some lubricant, try graphite, but very sparingly, or you will have another kind of mess as the graphite spreads to areas you never intended it to go. Reed valves - plastic, or leather? Some accordions are now made with plastic reed valves (ventilli) rather than the more traditional leather. Is this an improvement in accordion quality and performance, or just a cheaper way to build an accordion? Plastic reed valves have some apparent advantages. They are lighter and more flexible, and therefore may open under less bellows pressure. If this were to allow the reed to respond more quickly, it would improve accordion performance. After all, rapid reed response is one of the highly desirable characteristics of reeds. But if the amount of air flow required to open the leather reed valve is already less than that required to sound the reed, then a valve that opens even earlier would offer no real advantage. Previous observations lead me to predict that if the plastic ventilli do offer any advantage, it will be most apparent at the higher frequency reeds. These are the smallest reeds in the accordion, which require the least air flow to sound, and which do not normally have leathers because the air flow required to sound the reed is not sufficient to force a leather valve open. Installing a leather on these small reeds significantly delays their response or silences them entirely. It is here that the plastic ventilli, if it actually opens under less pressure, would be most helpful. But it is also here that leathers are least needed, because the leakage around these tiny reeds is already very limited by their size. I therefore suspect that although plastic ventilli probably do offer some performance advantage at the higher notes, and especially on handmade reeds which require even less air to operate, the advantage is likely to be small. Plastic ventilli offer another apparent advantage. The plastic seems much less likely than leather to curl away from the reed plate, because plastic is lighter and less likely to sag, and because it is impermeable to moisture, which is reputed to be one of the major contributors to the curling of leather. However, plastic cannot duplicate one of the reputed functions of leather, which is to help keep the reeds dry by absorbing moisture from the air. The importance of this function is a matter for debate, and the question is moot in cases where the accordion is not subjected to moisture. Nevertheless, leather reed valves might have an advantage on this point. Plastic ventilli are available in more distinct lengths than leather reed valves, and thus offer time savings during installation by eliminating the need to field cut leathers to the proper length for each reed. They are also less expensive than leather, although leather reed valves cost only about ten cents each in large quantities, amounting to about $35 for a full set for a full size 41/120 4/5 accordion. So which should we use? Until I or someone else experimentally confirms that plastic noticeably improves reed performance, I will continue replacing leather with leather and plastic with plastic unless I feel the leather might be adversely impacting the response of a particular reed, in which case I will substitute a plastic ventillo. Polishing your accordion Accordion manufacturers polish the celluloid finish on their accordions using large floor mounted buffing wheels and a series of successively finer abrasive buffing compounds. They do this polishing prior to attachment of grilles, straps, metal trim, etc, and before the accordion is assembled. At the polishing stage, the treble and bass cabinets are devoid of keys, buttons, reed blocks, and bellows. The operator stands in front of the rotating cloth buffing wheel, applies buffing compound to the wheel, then presses the bare accordion cabinet into it, being careful not to generate enough heat to cloud the surface of the celluloid. When he has it uniformly shiny, he switches to a different buffing wheel where a liquid polish is used for the final finish. Although few of us have large buffing wheels at our disposal, we should adopt this general approach whenever we polish our accordion, even if we polish by hand. That is, the accordion should be disassembled and the individual components polished separately. In this way we avoid leaving unsightly deposits of buffing compound under the edges of metal trim parts, at the junction of treble grille and treble cabinet, on the grille cloth at grille openings, and in between keys and buttons. This approach also allows us to polish what would otherwise be difficult to reach corners where cabinet and trim parts meet. Using buffing compound and a powered buffing wheel saves time and effort, but even fairly significant marring of the finish can be polished out by hand if you apply buffing compound in sequentially finer grades along with a lot of \"elbow grease\". For the final finish, use the micro-abrasive polishing compounds sold in auto parts stores specifically for restoring the clarity of plastic automobile head lamp lenses. Don't use so much that it flows over the surface or into little nooks and crannies where you can't get it all out. In between these major polishings, we need only wipe off the finish with a soft cloth. If the finish is really grungy, the cloth can be dampened with rubbing alcohol, but no liquid should ever be poured or sprayed onto or into your accordion. Slathering wax all over your accordion, then buffing it out like you would your car just makes a mess, due to all the angles, joints, and other irregularities in the surface. Besides, mechanically polished celluloid is naturally shiny, and does not require wax. If the finish has dulled, wax will not improve it much anyway. The marring and scratches should be mechanically buffed out just as they originally were at the factory. Special care should be taken with the keyboard. Keys can be cleaned in place using a soft cloth dampened with rubbing alcohol. But never allow any liquid to run down in between the keys. The keys and keyboard are usually made of unfinished wood. Moisture absorbed into the wood can cause local swelling and warping, which in turn can cause keys to stick. For particularly difficult key cleaning jobs, see the article on cleaning and buffing keys. The real key to keeping your accordion shiny is not to let it get dirty in the first place. If you protect it from scratches and wipe it off with a soft dry cloth or chamois each time you play, it may never need to be polished. Proper shoulder strap lengths Accordion shoulder straps come in mismatched pairs, that is, one strap is longer than the other. If you examine them closely, you will see that the upper portion of each is identical, and all the variation is in the tail, which connects to the bottom of the accordion. The strap on the right has the longer tail because the accordion must sit left of your center. Depending on your size and the location of the strap brackets on the accordion, the right shoulder strap might be 4 to 6 inches longer than the left when properly adjusted. When adjusting your straps, you should begin with the left one and adjust it short enough to hold the accordion suspended from your left shoulder so that the centers of the black keys on the right side of the accordion are directly under your chin, and the top of the accordion is about four inches below your chin. Then adjust the right strap long enough to accommodate the accordion position achieved with the left strap alone. Many accordions have straps too long to be adjusted in this manner. In that case, you might be able to punch more holes in either or both ends of the strap segments to allow them to be shortened by adjusting the buckles. But if this still will not allow the straps to be adjusted tightly enough, you will have no choice but to shorten them. In this case I generally switch the tails so the shorter tail goes with the right strap, so I only have to shorten one of them. In other words, the short tail becomes the long tail and the long tail gets shortened to become the new short tail, usually 4 to 6 inches shorter than the other. Begin by drilling out or prying apart the rivets that hold the large buckle in place. Note the location and size of the slot for the tongue of the buckle and the location and spacing of the rivet holes, and duplicate that pattern farther down the strap at a location that will produce a tail of the desired length. If you wish, you can cut off the excess strap length and use it as a template to make the new holes. Use new two-part rivets to install the buckle in the new location, in the same manner as it was originally installed. If you plan the tail lengths to fit when each tail's buckle tongue is in the middle hole of its upper strap, you will have ample room to make minor adjustments in either direction later.** Does your accordion need to be re-waxed? The hundreds of aluminum reed plates in your accordion are held to the wooden reed blocks by a mixture of beeswax, resin, and a small amount of linseed oil. Over time this mixture dries, hardens, and becomes brittle. Eventually, it will crack around the reed plates, allowing them to vibrate themselves loose. When your reeds start falling out, it is definitely time to re-wax. However, you might decide to re-wax before reeds start falling out. For instance, if your accordion needs tuning, the reeds should be thoroughly cleaned before tuning begins. This is because the dirt on them is probably what causes them to be out of tune. If you tune a dirty reed, then clean it later, it will need to be tuned again. You can short-cut by using a tiny brass wire brush to clean the outside of each reed tongue, but it is practically impossible to clean the side facing into the reed block. The only way to thoroughly clean them is to take them out of the reed blocks first. This naturally requires waxing them back in after they are cleaned. If very many reeds need tuning, you might as well re-wax the whole thing. There are other reasons to re-wax. The quality of the sound your accordion produces is partially dependent on the condition of the wax. This is because the reed itself produces only a feeble sound until it is anchored to a reed plate and until that reed plate is anchored into a reed block, which in turn is mounted to an accordion. The vibrations of the reed tongue are transmitted through the rivet to the reed plate, then through the wax to the reed block, then through the wooden reed block and on into the accordion cabinet. That's why you can feel the accordion vibrating against your chest as you play it. The accordion cabinet is a bit like the sound board in a piano, or the body of an acoustic guitar. The quality of the sound we hear depends on the efficiency with which those vibrations are transmitted through the various materials, including the wax, as well as on the quality and construction of the reeds and cabinet. Old brittle wax transmits sound differently. Fresh wax could make your accordion sound more like it did when it was new. However, re-waxing is very time consuming and expensive. If you pay to have it done, the cost could exceed the market value of your accordion. In this case you might decide to forego the new wax and just spot tune the reeds needing it most. You might also decide to wax it yourself, in which case you might be interested in the article on waxing reeds to be posted soon on Accordion Repair 2 of this website. When is it time for a new bellows? If an accordion uses very little air, we often describe it as having a good, tight bellows. If it uses lots of air, we sometimes say it has a leaky bellows. But often the leaks are actually elsewhere, in which case replacing the bellows will not solve the problem. How can we know if our bellows should be replaced? Some people replace their bellows just to get a different color. But a new bellows installed can cost $350 to $450. At these costs, you probably prefer not to replace your bellows unless it is truly necessary. The first step is to determine exactly what is leaking. A good article on how to analyze and locate your air leaks is posted elsewhere on this page. Following the procedures outlined there should help you find and fix your leaks, and may save you the expense of a new bellows. If you find the bellows leaking, you may want to replace it, as bellows repair is time consuming and costly, and often leaves the bellows looking a bit rough. However, it still may be economical to repair your old bellows if you do it yourself. If you have eliminated all other possible sources, and if you know your leak is an external leak as defined in the \"finding leaks\" article, you may conclude that your bellows probably has lots of small leaks, each too small to detect, that add up to a lot of lost air. In that case, replacing your bellows will probably breathe new life into your accordion and be well worth the cost. You might also decide to replace your bellows if it has more than two or three loose metal corners. A few corners can be replaced fairly economically (especially if you don't mind leaving the bellows tape in a bit of a mess right at the corners), but replacing them all costs about as much as a new bellows, especially if the bellows is re-taped at the same time. If just a few corners have come loose because the glue has failed, it may make sense to repair it. But if the corners are loose because the metal has cracked, then many other corners are also likely to be cracked and will work loose shortly, in which case you will be better off with a new bellows. You might also consider a new bellows if most of your bellows tape needs replacing, as the labor cost of re-taping an entire bellows could exceed half the cost of a new bellows. The advantages of having a new bellows might outweigh the savings realized from replacing just the tape. These advantages include a long trouble-free service life, a newer appearance, improved air tightness, improved stability, and the opportunity to pick a new color. Improved stability is a factor worth mentioning. Sometimes, even when they don't leak, old bellows just get so loose and flexible that they tend to bulge out of alignment under compression, requiring you to follow them around a bit in order to push them closed. If your bellows starts acting more like a Slinky than a bellows, you might be happier with a new one. You will find two bellows-related articles on the \"Accordion Repair 2\" page of this website - \"Replacing Bellows Tape\", and \"Installing a New Bellows\". In the future you will also find an article on general bellows repairs. Is it time to revalve the treble side? If you find leaks at the treble valves, you might be able to adjust the pallets to stop the leak. Check first to see that the offending pallets are centered over their ports and that all four corners as well as the centers of each side of each pallet are in firm contact with the foundation plate, and adjust them as necessary for a good seal by bending the key rods. To check for firm contact, cut a narrow strip of paper to use as a feeler gauge under the valve to be sure you have equal drag on all four corners and along each side. See the discussion on leveling the keyboard in the article titled \u201cSetting Up a Treble Keyboard for Shallow Action\u201d for some useful tips on how to bend the key rods without damaging the keys or pallets, and for instructions on how to make the tools you need. Also make sure no debris is lodged under the pallet that might prevent a good seal. If you find all four corners snug, but poor contact along the middle of one or both sides, then you probably have a warped pallet, in which case you will have to remove the pallet, strip off the valve facing, sand the pallet flat, and install new valve facing. If the pallet seems to have firm contact all around, yet still leaks, then remove the key, fluff up the nap of the leather valve facing with a tooth brush, and reinstall it (see the discussion on how to disassemble various kinds of keyboards in the article titled \u201cSetting Up a Treble Keyboard for Shallow Action\u201d). If the leak persists after all this, it is probably because the surface of the valve is pillowed due to compression of the felt liner. It is normal for the nap of the leather to be flattened around the port, leaving a visual image of the ports in the leather facing, but if you can also feel a raised waffle pattern left by the ports, then it may be time to re-valve.** This pillowy waffle pattern is caused by compression of the felt under the leather valve facing due to age and normal wear. Whenever you see noticeable pillowing, you will be better off to re-valve, because the new valves will seal better and will also operate more quietly. If such a valve is off center and you try to center it, the waffle pattern will no longer fit exactly into the ports, and the valve will still leak. The only solution in this case is to replace the valve facing with new leather/felt laminate. If one valve is pillowed, all the others are probably also pillowed, in which case it is time to re-valve the treble side of the accordion. The bass valves normally have thinner felt pads which are much less prone to pillowing. You might decide to re-valve even if no valves are leaking. If any of your treble keys are higher than the ends of the keyboard cabinet, this is usually evidence of valve felt compression. Place a long straightedge lengthwise down the keyboard, extending past the keys at both ends of the keyboard. When the accordion left the factory, all the keys were probably level with the ends of the keyboard. The extent to which you can depress keys with this straightedge is the extent to which compression of your treble valve facings has allowed the keys to rise. Compressed felt is less effective as a cushion, resulting in more noise when the valve slams shut under the pressure of its return spring. The compressed felt also allows the key to return to a higher position, thus lengthening the key stroke and giving the spring more time to accelerate the valve, giving it more momentum to dissipate upon closing. Most of this momentum is dissipated as noise. Leveling the keyboard can eliminate this extra travel and the resulting extra momentum, but it does nothing to make the felt a more effective cushion. If you have a clunky noisy keyboard, re-valving is the best way to improve it. See the article titled \"Renewing Treble Valves\" for tips on how to do it, where to get the felt and leather laminate, and other options for improving and quieting your keyboard action. Making treble keyboard bending tools You sometimes need to raise or lower treble keys, either to correct one that has been bent upward by catching on a case or strap, or to compensate for different rates of deterioration and compression of the felt valve padding, or to compensate for a slightly different thickness of valve facing material used to re-valve, or to set up the keyboard for shallower action. Raising or lowering treble keys is accomplished by bending the key rods. But let's start with how not to bend key rods, as some people are tempted to try shortcuts, which seldom work out as desired. For instance, do not hold the key down while you press down on the treble pallet, and do not simply pull up on a key to raise it. Either of these actions will compress the felt valve padding, perhaps producing the desired result temporarily, but only until the felt lofts again to near its original thickness over the next few hours. Using this \"shortcut\" could also loosen the treble pallet's connection to the key rod, which is often just a bed of wax. If your \"shortcut\" over-stresses the key's hinge point on wooden keyboards, you may crack the key or the wooden boss on the keyboard cabinet that holds the spindle. On older accordions with the key rod driven into the wooden key like a nail, you also risk loosening the key rod's connection to the key, necessitating a time- consuming repair. The correct way to bend key rods is with two bending tools, one gripping the rod on each side of the point where you want to make the bend. For raising or lowering the key, place the bend as close as possible to the key. If this puts the pallet out of parallel with the foundation plate, causing the valve to leak, then make the compensating bend as close as possible to the pallet. All this is explained in more detail in the article on setting up a treble keyboard. The main thrust of this article is to describe the bending tools and how to make them. The simplest tool is a steel rod with a slot cut in one side of it just the right depth and width to grip the key rod. The problem is that key rods come in many sizes, creating the need for many tools unless you make a set of adjustable tools. We'll get to a couple of designs for adjustable tools shortly, but first let's cover the simple ones. If you are only working on one accordion, then a few simple tools may be all you need. Here is a photo of some of the non-adjustable bending tools I have made from steel rods and bolts. The narrower tools are essential for working on short key rods. The first and second tools from the right, with large grip handles and with slots in the end, are for bending the key rod side to side in order to center the pallet over its ports. The fourth and fifth from the right are for twisting the flatbar style of key rod in order to rock its pallet into parallel with the foundation plate. Note that in each case pairs of tools are used together. The third tool from the right has small pegs through it to engage the key rod, and is useful (in conjunction with one of the other tools) for putting bends very close to the pallet. Here is a close up photo of it. Adjusting valves down inside a tone chamber requires special tools that reach down into the chamber. The seventh and eighth tools from the right in the top photo have worked well on some tone chamber accordions, but I expect to have to make different tools with different slot widths to fit other accordions which have different key rod widths.** My tool design is still evolving, and I expect it will continue to improve. If you come up with any better tool design ideas, I hope you will share them with me. When designing your bending tools, keep four considerations in mind. The first is that the tool must be narrow enough to fit down between adjacent key rods. This dimension varies with different accordions, but bulky tools just won't fit. The second is that wider tools with longer slots to grip the key rod do less damage to the soft aluminum key rods (very narrow tools cause unsightly gouges in the aluminum). The third consideration is that for the short key rods on the black keys, wider tools are not practical, since they do not allow you to put one bend close to the key and another bend close to the pallet. Tools wide enough to preclude any damage to the key rod are also wide enough to occupy the entire length of a short key rod when used in pairs, eliminating any choice on where to place the bend. For your black keys, you will therefore need narrow tools and you will have to live with the divots they leave in the key rods. The fourth consideration is that when raising a key, you will have to move the tools toward each other, and their handles may need to bypass each other in order to make the desired bend, so slender handles work best. You can help minimize key rod damage by making your narrower tools from square rod, rather than round. For any given tool width, this maximizes the contact surface between the tool and the key rod, thus spreading the load. You can also minimize the damage by making the slots just barely wide enough to receive the key rod. A tight fit helps maximize the contact surface between the tool and the key rod, spreading the load over a wider area, thus minimizing the damage. Making your bending tools about six inches long will give you sufficient leverage to bend the key rods. Minimizing the amount of rod extending beyond the lower edge of the slot will help make the tool fit closer to the pallet, making it possible to get your two bend points farther apart, which is particularly important on the black keys and any white keys with short key rods. Here is a photo of some adjustable bending tools I have recently made. The one on the right has a slot in the lower jaw to straddle the key rod extending down into a tone chamber. In the next photo the three on the right above have been disassembled so you can see how they are made. The set screw threads into one half of the tool and rides in a slot in the other half of the tool. The one in the middle has an adjustable slot on each end. The two halves of that tool were made to different lengths to provide different adjustment ranges at each end of the tool. The three extra holes in the tool on the right are unnecessary. They were already in the angle before I converted it to this use. The adjustment, of course, is to allow for gripping a wide variety of key rods of varying thicknesses. I made the tool on the left from some recycled cold formed slotted channel (originally used to mount adjustable shelf brackets to a wall), and from some 1/4\" steel plate I cut from a scrap of 4-inch wide 1/4-inch flat bar. To eliminate the need for a bulky nut, I tapped #10-32 threads in the 1/4-inch plate to receive the pan head set screw. When slightly loosened, the set screw can slide in a 3/4-inch long slot cut into the web of the channel. This gives me an adjustment range of 9/16- inch (3/4-inch minus 3/16-inch for the diameter of the #10 machine screw). I am not a professional tool designer. Although these tools serve their purposes, I am sure more elegant designs are possible, and I encourage you to experiment. If you care to share your improved design, I would love to know about it. - GB Freeing sticking keys Treble keys sometimes stick open due to dirt or corrosion on the key or the spindle (axle rod), due to warping of wooden keys, or due to bending of aluminum keys. Repairing a key that sticks open requires removing the key, after first removing the grill and possibly the treble switch assembly. On accordions without individually removable keys, pull the spindle out far enough to release the sticking key. Look for the ends of the spindles (or spindle) under a small metal cover on the bottom of the keyboard. If you remove the spindle or spindles without first securing the keys in place, the key springs will fling the keys off the keyboard one at a time as the spindle is withdrawn, so plan to catch them. If they are not already numbered, number each key as it comes off to facilitate getting them all back in their proper places. The usual numbering system is 1 through 41 starting at the bottom of the keyboard if all keys are on one spindle. If there are two spindles, the black and white keys are numbered separately. If you prefer not to remove all the keys above the problem key, and if there are two spindles, you can tape the keys together so that one spindle will hold all keys in place, as described in the following paragraph. If there is only one spindle, you can avoid removing all the keys by clamping them in place in accordance with the paragraph after that. If white and black keys have separate spindles, you can usually avoid removing other keys by taping all the keys (except the keys to be removed) to each other before pulling out the appropriate spindle. (Use 3M Scotch Brand #218 plastic masking tape, as other tapes leave a sticky residue). Place one row of tape near the ends of the white keys and two rows over the black keys, taping to the tops of the white keys and to the sides and tops of the black keys. If you pull out just one spindle, the other spindle and the tape will hold all the taped keys in place. If there is only one spindle for all the keys, you can clamp in place the keys you do not wish to remove, using large spring clamps with extended jaws to hold rods and shims against the keys. A single clamp can hold a wood ruler or similar shaped plastic or aluminum rod across the ends of the white keys, pressing them all down under the clamp's spring pressure. Two other long-jawed spring clamps (bolt 6-inch wood, plastic, or metal extensions to the jaws) can be used to press another similar rod down onto the white and black keys right where the black keys emerge to the level of the tops of the white keys, i.e., at the key hinge point. Finally, a third rod is used as a shim between the extended clamp jaws and the tops of the black keys to help hold the black keys in place. Just make sure none of the rods or shims extends out over the keys you wish to remove. Grip the end of the spindle with small vice-grip pliers, and twist while pulling. Pull the spindle out just far enough to release the sticking key. Lift the key out, carefully noting the placement of the key spring. The free end of the spring must point toward the outer end of the key (not toward the valve), and usually rides in a tiny groove in the wood. Note that this technique does not work on a few models in which both spindles pass through holes in each key. In this case both spindles must be at least partially withdrawn in order to remove any key from either spindle. While you have the spindle partially out, take a close look at it. If it appears dirty or corroded, remove it entirely and clean it with steel wool before reinstalling it. Inspect the key and the keyboard slot for any dirt or lint that could cause the binding, and for shiny spots that indicate where the key is rubbing. For all-wood keys, sand away the shiny spot, finishing with 600 grit sandpaper. For wooden keys with aluminum core, and for all-aluminum keys, very slightly bend the short aluminum tab on the bottom away from the side where it was rubbing to eliminate interference with the slot in the aluminum keyboard. If this tab appears worn or scratched, you should also smooth it out with fine sandpaper and finish it with steel wool. Another option is to shift the key to one side by slightly bending the key hinge. Keep in mind that a very tiny bend at the hinge point results in a relatively large sideways shift out at the end of the key. Reinstall the key and its spring and reinstall the spindle, taking care not to bend it. To avoid bending it, remove a drill chuck from a drill motor (or buy a new drill chuck) and slide it onto the rod, tightening it about four inches from the bottom of the keyboard. Use the chuck to twist and push the rod in, then loosen the chuck, slide it back, tighten it, and push again. If the spindle is brass, avoid marring its finish. You may have to press the keys slightly down into proper alignment to allow the spindle to pass through. The end of the spindle is tapered, so you may be able to see the keys move slightly as the point enters the bore and forces the keys to center themselves on the spindle. If your accordion has a tone chamber, you may find that some of the black key rods intertwine with some of the white key rods in a way that makes it impossible to take out just the black keys or just the white keys. Similarly, you may find that both spindles pass through separate holes in each key. In either of these cases you will have to pull out both spindles and when you put it back together you will have to install black and white keys and both spindles together, and the drill chuck idea will not work because the spindles are too close together. To solve this problem you can make aluminum, plastic, or hard rubber jaws for your small vise grip pliers that allow you to grip each spindle from the side an inch or so away from where it enters the cabinet without marring the smooth finish on the spindle. Here is one I made by hammering some 1/8\" aluminum flat bar around the jaws of an old pair of vice grip pliers. I squeezed those jaws around a file spinning in my drill press to form a rounded groove across each jaw to better grip the spindle. Here is a keyboard going back together using those pliers. If there is no cover on the bottom of the keyboard and no access to the bottom ends of your spindles, then the keys are individually removable. Individually removable keys have slots that engage a spindle that can only be removed after all the keys are out. There are five basic types. The most common type uses a short, stiff retainer spring to hold the spindle in the horizontal leg of an L-shaped slot in the bottom of the key, or more accurately, an L-shaped slot in the brass hinge assembly riveted to the bottom of the key. You cannot see this spring or the slot until you get the key out. You remove these keys by pressing down hard and toward the valve end of the rod in order to get the spindle out of the horizontal leg of the L-shaped slot (by overcoming the force of the retainer spring) and into the vertical leg, then pulling up on the key to lift it off the spindle. Press on the key right where it rotates on the spindle, pushing down and horizontally, then lift vertically by gripping the key rod as close as possible to the key. In this explanation, horizontal means parallel to the key top. Once you have your sticking key out, inspect and repair it as above. To reinstall the key, place it back in its slot with the stiff spring against the keyboard side of the spindle and press the key in the direction of the valve to compress the stiff spring in order to allow the spindle to enter the vertical leg of the slot. As you press the key down, the stiff spring will force the spindle into the horizontal leg of the slot to hold the key in place. A second type of removable key is similar, except they have only a vertical slot (no horizontal leg) and a short coil spring to hold the key in place that must be removed first. With the grille off, you can peak in under the backs of the keys and see these little springs. In these cases, there is often a little tool fastened to the underside of the grille or to the foundation plate under the grille. If not, you can make one from a small screwdriver or any slender steel or aluminum rod. Here are a couple of photos of one I made. The upper end of the coil spring stays connected to the key; you remove the bottom end of the spring from the aluminum tang by pressing the loop on the end of the coil spring downward and off the free end of the tang. You can remove them with practically anything, but you will need the special tool to put them back on. There is a third type of removable key that has a simple aluminum fork on the bottom of the key that straddles the axle of a brass bushing that rotates on the spindle. This type always has the little coil springs described above. After removing the spring, you just pull straight up on the key, using a good grip on the key rod. Some of these are really stubborn and you have to pull really hard with pliers. It is not unusual to have to pull so hard that when it finally suddenly releases, you are unable to stop before the pallet hits something and is knocked off the key rod, so you should have some reed wax handy to wax it back on. See the article on waxing with a modified soldering iron for more details. If you don't get it waxed back on in exactly the same position, and if the leather seal has \"pillowed\" into the ports, it will leak due to the \"pillow\" no longer aligning properly with the port, in which case the best solution will be to replace the felt/leather laminate valve facing on that pallet. See the article on \"re-valving the treble side\". If you have these forked keys and brass bushings, and if you conclude that your problem is high friction between the brass bushing and the spindle or between the brash bushing and its slot in the aluminum chassis, then you will have to take all the keys out and remove the aluminum keyboard chassis from the accordion in order to get the spindle out to clean it. In this case, all the brass bushings will fall out as you remove the spindle, so figure a way to catch them. You can clean them in a little jar of WD-40, agitating it well, then blow them dry with compressed air. Test each of them on the spindle to make sure they all turn freely. Doing this may help clean additional corrosion and dirt out of the interior bore in the bushing. As you put them back in their slots in the aluminum chassis one at a time, feeding in the spindle as you go, make sure each one turns absolutely freely on the spindle and in its slot in the aluminum chassis before installing the next one. The bushings vary up to .004 inch in width, and if you happen to get one of the wider ones in one of the narrower slots in the chassis, it may rub on the chassis. In this case, either find a narrower bushing or file the slot a little wider, but not too wide, or the key may wander too much and interfere with a neighboring key. Every bushing must turn absolutely freely in its slot and on the spindle in order for the keyboard to work smoothly. If some of the key forks are too tight to fit over the brass bushing with moderate pressure, check the sides of them for burrs or spalling and sand these off smooth. If you conclude that the fork is too narrow, you can file it a bit wider, but don't file too much, or the key will be sloppy. You want a snug fit. Don't use any oil, as it will attract lint and dust, which will eventually gum it up and cause keys to stick. This type of keyboard takes longer to clean and adjust, but in the end you will be rewarded, because once it is cleaned and properly adjusted, this design offers the smoothest keyboard action of all. The fourth type of individually removable key is held in place by a sliding clip on each key that slides in under the spindle. Use a flat blade screwdriver to pry the clip away from the spindle (that is, toward the valve end of the key), and lift the key straight up. To replace it, press the key down over the spindle and slide the clip back in. The fifth type has a slotted head twist-fastener right above the spindle on each key. Use a flat blade screwdriver to turn the slotted head of the fastener 90 degrees left to release the key, then pull the key straight up. To put it back, press the key into position over the spindle and turn the fastener 90 degrees to the right. In all cases, test the key for smooth action before returning the accordion to service. Trouble-shooting silent reeds Silent reeds might be missing, loose, misaligned, or broken, but usually they are just stuck because of foreign matter lodged between the reed tongue and the vent (slot in the reed plate). The hardest part is to positively identify which reed tongue is silent. You can always use your tuning bellows to test each reed in each reed block, in each airflow direction, out on the workbench. But there is a quicker way. First determine which switch controls the problem reed, and in which bellows direction the problem occurs. Then open the accordion and take out the reed blocks to determine which slides are opened by that switch. This tells you which row on the reed block contains your problem reed. Now press the problem key to see which valve opens, and hence, which reed plate in that row contains the silent reed (for example, the fifth valve controls the fifth reed plate in the reed block). If the reed was silent only when the bellows was expanding (air rushing in), then the problem is with the reed tongue on the inside of the reed block, behind the visible leather. If it was silent only when the bellows was compressing (air rushing out), then the problem is with the reed tongue facing you, on the outside of the reed block. If it is the outer tongue, you might cure it by simply plucking it lightly with a single edge razor blade slipped carefully under the tip (to avoid scratching either the reed or the reed plate). Pluck it just enough to get it vibrating. If you can hear the tone of the reed at all, you have probably already cleared it. But if it sounds dull, you may need to take further measures to dislodge foreign matter from between the reed tongue and the vent. Try passing a .0015\u201d metal feeler gauge between the sides of the reed tongue and the vent (slot in the reed plate), but don\u2019t push it in very far, or you will dislodge the leather glued to the opposite side of the reed plate. Then pluck the reed tongue again to see if it seems to be vibrating freely. You can also test it on your tuning bellows if you have one. However, you should avoid blowing the reed like a harmonica, as this could get moisture on the reed, causing it to rust. If the problem was with the inner tongue, try the feeler gauge approach. You will not be able to pluck the reed to check your progress, but you can test it on your tuning bellows, if you have one. If passing the feeler gauge around the sides does not clear it, check the tip. The feeler gauge is too wide to use to clean the narrow end of the vent, but you can use it to clean off the tip of the reed tongue and also to lift the reed tip out of the way (not too far, as you do not want to bend it permanently) while you clean the end of the vent with a tiny brass wire brush, or a straight pin, or even a toothpick. If cleaning fails to solve the problem, then check for misalignment of the reed tongue that causes interference between the reed tongue and the vent. You will probably have to pry the reed plate out of the wax to do this, then wax it back into the reed block after you have repaired it, so if you are not prepared to wax it back in, you should take it to a repairman. If you proceed on your own, hold the reed plate up to a bright light to verify that you have the tongue centered. If the tongue is out of center, pry it back into position. If it moves at all easily, you may have to reset the rivet with a light hammer blow (on an anvil, naturally) after you have the tongue centered. Voicing reeds You can often significantly improve the performance of your accordion by voicing the reeds. Voicing is setting the tip clearance of the reed tongue above the plane of the reed plate. If the tip is set too high, too much air will escape under it, delaying the onset of vibration, requiring more air to get it started. If it is set too low, it will choke under high bellows pressure. That means it will refuse to vibrate, perhaps because it closes off the reed vent too soon, before it has achieved enough velocity and momentum to travel far enough to cause a rebound powerful enough to start the oscillation. Changing the tip clearance obviously requires permanently bending the reed tongue. You can't voice the reed just by lightly flexing it or by gently stroking it, or it will simply spring back to its original position. If you want it to take a permanent set at a new level relative to the reed plate, then you have to bend it far enough to exceed its elastic limit (which by definition is the bending limit beyond which it will not spring completely back to its original position). However, you also want the reed tongue to remain straight and parallel with the top of the reed plate or angled slightly up from it, but not having any curvature, so you have to make sure the permanent bend occurs very close to the rivet. You can't just grab it by the tip and push or pull, or the bend might occur somewhere midway along the reed tongue, or perhaps even close to the tip, especially on the smallest reeds. To get it to yield close to the rivet, you should apply the force at least half way down the tongue. This is where the reed tongue is wider and possibly thicker, and where you have the least leverage, so you have to push or pull pretty hard, and there is the rub. If you push or pull too hard, the permanent deflection may be greater than you want, in which case you will have to bend it back the other way by exceeding the elastic limit again. There is a limit to the number of times you can do this, because each time you exceed the elastic limit, you raise the elastic limit of the steel in the area of the bend so that even more force will be required to exceed the elastic limit at that location next time (this is sometimes called \"work hardening\" - you can see it in action by repeatedly bending and straightening any steel wire, such as a paper clip). As the elastic limit increases due to bending beyond the previous elastic limit, by definition the area of the bend becomes more resistant to permanent bending, so the next permanent bend tends to occur somewhere else, where the elastic limit has not yet been raised, and where it will therefore yield under less applied force. In practice, this means that if you want your permanent bend right next to the rivet, you have to get it right the first time, or at least very soon after that. If you exceed the elastic limit very many times, your bend might end up farther away from the rivet. If you somehow force it to bend at the exact same spot each time, then its elastic limit at that point will eventually be raised to the ultimatum yield point, at which point the reed tongue will break, rather than bend. This is not to say that there is a limit to how many times the reed can flex before it breaks. As far as I know, there is no such limit, as long as it does not flex beyond its elastic limit. Reeds flex millions (or maybe billions) of times during the life of an accordion, so you can try as many times as you like to bend the reed short of reaching its elastic limit, and you will not hurt it, but of course, you won't change its voicing, either. This all suggests that the best way to voice a reed is with several attempts, starting gently, and gradually increasing the applied force with each trial, checking each time to see if the latest attempt has succeeded in making a permanent bend. There is no penalty for applying too little force, other than a slight delay in reaching your objective. With experience, you will learn how much force to apply the first time, so you can avoid wasting a lot of time working up to the elastic limit, yet still be reasonably certain that you will not exceed the limit on your first try. I say \"reasonably certain\" because reeds vary in hardness and in their elastic limits, and even after you have experience, you will undoubtedly encounter some reeds that are much softer and with lower elastic limits than most, and which take a permanent bend much sooner (and farther) than you expect. When this happens, you should reduce the force you use in subsequent trials, and try to work gradually up to the lower elastic limit of that particular reed. The tools used in voicing are very simple. For lifting an exterior reed tongue to increase its tip clearance, you just need a thin piece of metal to get behind the reed tongue and evenly support the upper half to two thirds of it while you bend it upward. I use a dull single edge razor blade on small reeds, and a .010\" metal feeler gauge on larger reeds. For lowering an exterior reed tongue to decrease its tip clearance, you apply force in the lower half of the tongue, forcing it down into the vent. I use a flat blade screwdriver with a tip narrow enough to pass through the vent without scratching the sides. To avoid letting the screwdriver slip toward the tip of the reed tongue, I hold the screwdriver shank nearly parallel to the reed and rock the tip into the tongue, rather than poking it straight in. If you are voicing an interior reed tongue on a reed mounted in its reed block, the process is similar. To increase the tip clearance, rock the screwdriver tip down into the vent and against the tongue at a point about a third of the way up from the rivet. If you try to leave the leather on while you do this, you are likely to damage it, so I think you are better off to remove the leather to better see what you are doing, as well as to allow you to work from the fixed end of the reed tongue. Glue the leather (or a new one) back on when you are finished. On larger reeds, you often must push the tongue so far in that it hits the back of its reed chamber and visibly bends to conform to the limits of the chamber. There is some risk that in addition to bending near the rivet, the tongue will bend in the opposite direction about where it contacts the back of the reed chamber. Such a bend puts undesirable curvature in the reed tongue, making it impossible to voice it correctly until it is straightened. If you are exerting force at about the 1/3 point, the reed tongue will nearly always reach its elastic limit near the rivet before it does in the area of the reverse bend, but not always. The major exception is with some handmade reed sets in which a few of the largest treble bassoon reeds have a a very thin cross section near the rivet and a step up in thickness about half way out from the rivet. On those reeds, the tongue will reach its elastic limit and take a permanent bend near the rivet, but it is also likely to take a permanent bend in the reverse direction right at the step up in thickness, somewhere near the middle of the reed tongue. If this occurs, you will have to remove the reed from the reed block to straighten that tongue before you can voice it. To save wear and tear on the reed, it is best to remove this type of reed from the reed block before you try to increase the tip clearance of the inner tongue. Increase the clearance to match the clearance of its properly voiced twin on the opposite side of the reed plate, then wax it back in. This Binci handmade reed has been flipped over to show what happened to the interior reed tongue when I tried to increase its tip clearance without removing the reed from the reed block. The reed would no longer sound until after I removed it, straightened it, properly voiced it, and waxed it back in. To decrease the tip clearance of an interior reed tongue, you must push the tongue up into the vent. This is the trickiest scenario, because you must work through the hole in the bottom of the reed block, where it is hard to see exactly where your tool is contacting the reed tongue. In addition, the upward force you apply on the reed tongue might jack the reed plate right out of its wax mounting if you don't adequately support it. It is also harder to see and properly judge the amount of tip clearance and any impact you are having on it. Start by laying your pry bar (narrow screwdriver) on the exterior face of the reed plate to measure how much of the shank you will want inside the reed block in order for the tip to contact the interior reed tongue at the desired point, i.e., 1/3 of the way from the rivet to the tip. Make some kind of mark on the shank, then insert it up to the mark and align it with the interior reed tongue. As you rock the handle downward, using the interior edge of the reed chamber as a fulcrum, the screwdriver tip and the reed tongue will rise into the vent. Be sure to have a firm grip on the reed plate, squeezing it onto the reed block to prevent the upward force of the tool from pushing the reed plate out of the wax. As always, be gentle at first. Rock the tongue a little ways up into the vent, then check the tip clearance to see if you have decreased it. You want to approach the elastic limit of the reed tongue gradually, so as not to significantly overshoot. The goal is to have the minimum possible tip clearance that will not cause the reed to choke. Unfortunately, there is no way to know where the minimum is until you exceed it. Different reeds have different response times, even when properly voiced, so if you are really after the absolute best performance your reeds can deliver, you can\u2019t simply stop when the response seems pretty good. Well, you can, and in fact that is almost certainly good enough, but who among us can stop there, if there may be some possibility of getting even better response? To get the absolute best possible response, you need to find the point where the reed begins to choke, then widen the clearance the minimum amount to get it to not choke. If you are opening up the clearance on a reed that has already been choking, this just comes naturally. But if you are narrowing the clearance on a reed that has been responding too slowly, then you will have to keep narrowing it bit by bit until it begins to choke under sudden high pressure on your test bellows. Of course, that means you have gone too far, and will have to exceed the elastic limit one more time to put it right, but that\u2019s okay, as long as you don\u2019t do it too many times. Voicing requires patience. After several failed attempts to change the tip clearance, frustration can cause you to suddenly get too rough with it and bend it too far. It is important to very gradually increase the force applied with each attempt, i.e., bend it just very slightly farther each time, until you just barely exceed the elastic limit. You will know you have barely exceeded the elastic limit when the reed tip returns to a slightly different clearance than before. The optimum clearance is often about one reed tip thickness above the reed plate. However, this varies slightly from reed to reed, so simply measuring the clearance will not ensure optimum performance. You have to check it on your test bellows. Decrease the clearance a tiny bit at a time until you can just barely make the reed choke with a sudden onset of high bellows pressure on your test bellows, then back it off the minimum amount required to eliminate the choking. You have to be especially careful when voicing the very smallest piccolo reeds, as they are very thin and bend readily (the smallest ones are only about .002\" thick near the free end).The optimum tip clearance under the reed tongue is often too small to see without magnification (sometimes as little as .0015\"), making the required changes likewise too small to see. In this case you will be unable to monitor your progress visually unless you remove the reed from the reed block and view it under moderately high magnification, say 10x to 20x. In the absence of such magnification, if you actually see a change in tip clearance, you have almost certainly gone too far. It is very easy to bend these tiny reeds too far, or to ruin them by putting a visible bend or kink near the tip of the reed tongue. You want the bend to be imperceptibly small, and located very near the fixed end of the reed tongue. It is best to remove these tiny reeds from the reed block, make your bends under magnification so you can see your progress, test the voicing by placing the reed directly over the opening on the top of your test bellows, and wax the reed back into the reed block only after both its tongues have been properly voiced. You should push on these tiny reed tongues only within the bottom half of their length, and gently. Use a wooden toothpick or a tiny screwdriver or similar tool, taking extreme care not to let it slip toward the free end of the reed tongue, or you may inadvertently bend just the tip, which will ruin the reed (unless you are patient enough and fortunate enough to be able to straighten it under magnification, as described on page \"Accordion Repair 3\" near the end of the tuning article). When adjusting the tip downward, a good way to maintain control of your tool and of the pressure you apply is to rest the shank of your tool on the reed plate at the top (narrow) end of the reed vent, and rock the tip of your tool downward against the top of the reed tongue, forcing it down into the vent. This gives you precise control over how much pressure you apply, how far you deflect the reed tongue, and exactly where on the reed tongue you apply the pressure. Similarly, when lifting the tongue, support it along more than half its length, rather than just pulling on the very tip. Slide a dull single edge razor blade or a .002\" metal feeler gauge under the reed tongue to lift it. Be very careful not to bend it too far. If you actually feel it yield, then you almost certainly have gone too far and may have ruined the reed. It is best to begin with very light pressures and minimal deflections, checking each time on the test bellows to see if you have improved the voicing. It is impossible to voice these smallest reeds if they have been arched by excessive pressure during tuning, or if their tips have been bent up or down or twisted during tuning or voicing. You can sometimes hear the hiss of air escaping under these arched or twisted reed tongues before they begin to sound (if they sound at all). The easiest thing to do in these cases is to replace the reeds, but it is sometimes possible to straighten them. Take them out of the reed block and use 10X to 20X magnification to precisely locate the bends that need to be taken out, and to monitor your progress. Only after they are straightened can they be properly voiced. See the tuning section on the Accordion Repair 3 page for some suggestions for making and using bending tools under magnification. After all this bending and straightening, these tiny reeds will almost certainly be out of tune, so you will have to tune them. Hint: Use #220 grit or finer sandpaper and light pressure, rather than a file or scratcher, both of which are far too blunt and crude for these tiny reed tongues. The use of inappropriate tuning tools is probably what ruined these reeds in the first place. To make an appropriate tuning tool, you can wrap and glue narrow strips of fine sandpaper over the ends of short wooden rods, approximately 1/8\" square by three or four inches long. See the tuning section on the Accordion Repair 3 page for more information. Regardless of the size of the reed, voicing the exterior reed tongues is fairly straightforward because you have good access and (except on the smallest reeds) you can easily see your progress as the tip clearance increases or decreases. Seeing and judging the tip clearance of interior reed tongues, however, is more difficult. The apparent tip clearance varies with your viewing angle, so to monitor your progress it is important to view it from the same angle each time. It is also more difficult to bend the reed tongue outward, as you must work through the small opening in the bottom of the reed block. On the smallest reeds you will have to take special care not to press too near the tip of the reed tongue, and this is especially difficult to judge when working in such a confined space. Sometimes the geometry of the reed chamber will not allow you to use a straight tool to bend the reed tongue, in which case you will have to use something curved or bent. I solve this problem by using a couple of very small screwdrivers that I have bent for this purpose. If it seems easier, just take the reed out of the reed block while you voice it, then wax it back in. Good reed response is very desirable in an accordion. Many accordion players pay thousands of dollars extra for top quality accordions with handmade reeds because handmade reeds respond more quickly. Slow responding reeds throw off the timing of the music and cause your accordion to use more air. Fast reed response is especially important when playing very fast pieces and when playing softly, but is noticeable and very pleasing in any kind of playing. Whatever the quality of your reeds, you can optimize their response by ensuring that they are properly voiced. Piano Accordion Trouble-shooting Guide Bass terminology: The button is on the end of a piston which has pegs or tabs that engage levers on bellcranks (also called cams or pipes).

A standard 120/41 LMMH accordion has about 380 leathers in it, and given enough time they will all eventually need replacing. They should lie flat against the reed plate, but with age they begin to curl back. If they are curled back more than 1/16\u201d, they should probably be replaced, and if they are curled more than 1/8\u201d they definitely should be replaced. Nearly all old accordions need at least some of them changed, and many need all of them changed. Changing leathers is not difficult, and you can save money by doing it yourself. Bad leathers curl back like some of these: Good leathers lie flat like these: Marginal leathers hang open just a bit, like some of these: Before you try to change any reed leathers, take the reed blocks out of the accordion. You might get away with taking out just the one you want to work on, but it is safer to take them all out so you don't accidentally catch any leathers and bend them back while trying to sneak a completed reed block back down between two that you left in the accordion. If you have a 4-reed accordion, your reed blocks should look something like this: The outer leathers are very easy to change. You just strip the old one off and glue a new one on. To avoid throwing the reed out of tune, ensure that the new one gets anchored (glued) along the same amount of its length as the old one. The John Reuther book, Accordion Repair Made Easy, recommends using burnt shellac as glue, but burning the alcohol off a bowl of shellac until it becomes thick enough to use as glue seems a bit barbaric when you can buy equally good glue right off the shelf. Thanks to a tip from Kimric Smythe of Smythe Accordions in Oakland California, I have successfully used Indian Head Gasket Shellac or Versachem Lion Gasket Shellac, available in little brown 2 ounce plastic bottles at auto parts stores for about $3. One bottle is enough to glue several thousand leathers. When you first open the bottle, you will find a uselessly large applicator brush fixed to the lid. Scrape the glue off it and back into the bottle, use side-cutter pliers to cut the brush stem as close to the lid as possible, and throw the brush away. You will be using wooden toothpicks to apply the glue to your leathers. I have also successfully used Aleene's Original Tacky Glue, which comes in a convenient squeeze bottle. I squeeze a small bead of glue onto the end of the leather, then spread it with a wooden toothpick. This glue seems to stay soft better than the gasket shellac, and provides a stronger bond, but consequently is harder to remove. I'm sure there are many other glues that will work as well. If you choose to scrape the old glue off the reed plate (recommended), use a hard wood scraper. Cut a piece about 1/4\u201d x 1/4\u201d x about 6 inches long, and use your belt sander to put a beveled \u201cchisel\u201d edge on the end to use as your scraper. For really tough old glue, you can resort to an aluminum scraper, or maybe even a brass scraper, but be careful not to scratch the reed plate. Aluminum and brass scrapers can be made by hammering flat the end of a small diameter aluminum or brass rod or tube and filing it to the desired shape. Steel scrapers are inappropriate, as they will far too readily scratch the aluminum. Be sure to brush and shake out and/or blow away all the little bits of debris that might later lodge between a reed tongue and reed vent and silence a reed. An old tooth brush works well, as long as you are careful not to wedge a bristle between the reed tongue and the vent, which will be hard to get out. Scraping and brushing are worth the time. A little bit of cleanliness now will save you a lot of heartache later. However, don't use canned air, as it will chill the reeds and cause condensation to form. Reed leathers come only in certain lengths, so you will usually have to cut the next larger size down to fit the reed vent. You want the fixed end of the leather to butt up against the rivet and the free end to extend only about 1/32\u201d past the end of the reed vent. I use a single edge razor blade mounted in a window scraper to cut the leathers guillotine style. Cutting them with scissors does not work well, as it is nearly impossible to get a square cut. Curl the leather in your fingers to put a small amount of curvature in it (smooth side out, fuzzy side in), to bias it toward the reed plate. Don\u2019t put much curvature in it though, because if the center of it arches off the reed plate it will operate very noisily. You must make sure it lies perfectly flat on the reed plate. Apply the glue sparingly to the fuzzy side of the leather (along only that part of its length that you wish to anchor), because you do not want any excess glue to run down into the reed vent. Use a normally closed tweezers to grip the leather by the free end. Place the fixed end against the rivet, make sure the leather is centered laterally over the vent, press it into place with a finger, then release the tweezers. If necessary, you will have a few seconds to properly align it before the glue sets up. It will be dry enough to play the accordion after about a minute. Changing interior leathers takes more skill and patience than changing the exterior ones. It\u2019s a bit like building a ship in a bottle, as you are working in a really confined space through a very small opening. A headlamp is absolutely essential for seeing into the reed chamber while you work. Pull the old leather out with tweezers, and don\u2019t even try to clean the old glue off the reed plate, as it will be impossible to get out all the debris you will generate. It is better to leave all that stuff undisturbed and anchored into the new glue. Cut the leather to the proper length using the exterior reed vent and leather as your guide. It is critically important not to make it so long that it will hang up on the end of the reed chamber. Put a small amount of bias (curvature) into the leather, just as you did for the exterior leathers. Apply glue to the fuzzy side of one end of the leather, just as you do for exterior leathers, but this time you will have no choice but to grip the leather by the fixed (glued) end, which means you will inevitably get some glue on your tweezers. This will cause the leather to want to stick to your tweezers and come back out of the reed chamber with the tweezers when you pull the tweezers out. Sometimes you can prevent this by hooking the end of the leather behind the rivet, pulling the tweezers free, and letting the leather fall into place. It also helps to put a thin shim (the same thickness as the leather) between the jaws of the tweezers to prevent the tweezers from gripping the leather too tightly. The next step is to align the leather with the vent and then pat it into place using a small flat blade screwdriver, making sure it lies perfectly flat. It is critically important to ensure that the leather is not so close to the sides or end of the reed chamber that it will catch on the wood while operating. It is equally important to ensure that the leather does not touch the reed tongue right beside it in the reed chamber, or that reed will be silenced. You must also be careful not to get any glue on that reed tongue, as the weight of it will throw the reed out of tune. Finally, verify that the new leather operates freely by pressing the outer reed tongue into its slot far enough to lift the leather, and watching it fall back into place. The larger leathers sometimes have little metal spines (contrapelli) attached to stiffen them. They are generally held in place by leather \u201cdots\u201d of either 6 mm or 8 mm diameter. You can either buy new ones or reuse the old ones. Place the metal spine centered on the leather, put a small drop of fabric glue on the fuzzy side of the leather dot (I use a toothpick embedded in the glue to transport the dot to the reed valve), and while you hold the spine firmly in place with one finger, use another finger to press the dot into place over one end of the spine. Fabric glue dries almost instantly, so work quickly. I get my leathers, dots, and contrapelli from Letizia Bompezzo in Castelfidardo, Italy. I order via email, in English. I don\u2019t know if she has a minimum order size, as I normally order several thousand leathers at a time. In these quantities the average cost of the leathers is usually under $.10 each, depending on the mix of sizes. However, the freight from Italy significantly increases that cost (shipping cost on a recent order was $59.00), so to save on freight charges I sometimes order when I am also ordering a bellows or some other major component from another supplier, and I ask Ms. Bompezzo to deliver the leathers to my other supplier for shipment in the same box, which she has kindly done. She makes reed leathers in seven sizes, using thinner leather for the smaller sizes: Size name Dimensions Bassi 10mm x 60mm Terzetti 9 mm x 49 mm Ottavo bassi 7 mm x 46 mm I 7 mm x 41 mm II 7 mm x 36 mm III 6 mm x 30 mm IV 6 mm x 25 mm She also sells composite leathers (leathers with a mylar sheet glued to the fixed end as a stiffener) as an alternative to using the little metal spines (contrapelli) to stiffen the larger leathers. Here is her contact information: Bompezzo Letizia Via U. Foscolo, 33 60022 Castelfidardo (AN) Italia tel. 071 7822899 cell. 345 0016490 email: orlandoni.g@libero.it If you prefer not to order from Italy or in large quantity, FRM Enterprises (frment.com) also sells leathers, but has a $100 minimum order. This is fine if you also need straps, back pads, and other supplies, which can quickly add up to the minimum, but if all you need is a few leathers or other accordion parts, try Steve Burnside Accordion Services in Black Mountain, North Carolina. Email targetentertainment.net@gmail.com. Steve is a dealer for FRM Enterprises and can accommodate orders below FRM's minimum amount. Most accordions use real leather (goatskin) reed valves, as described above, but some designs use plastic \"ventilli\". Plastic ventilli are available in so many lengths that you seldom need to cut one to fit. You can buy them from accordion parts suppliers such as FRM Enterprises, or online. Some designs incorporate a hole to fit over the rivet, others are designed like leathers, to butt up against the rivet. I have not tried using alternate materials, but one reader of this site, Donald Thornhill, offers the following alternate sourcing tip. These are his words: \"I have found 1.5 mylar 1/4 inch wide audiotape to be excellent. 2 layers actually. One being shorter by 5/16 inch. I may be a little more cautious when I am at the last 25% of the 7 inch spool of tape as it will maybe have a little more curl from being on the reel. What I could do is maybe reserve that portion for the lower octave reeds vs the higher ones. Also, I put the oxide part inwards adjacent to the plate. I use epoxy for the glue...the kind that is in the two tubes. Best to avoid the cheap dollar store kind. The valves will allow themselves to be easily changed. You will also know it is 1.5 ml as a full 7 inch reel is 1200 feet (Not 1800 feet or 2400 feet etc.) Do not use acetate kind. Only the mylar. I am not sure of the kind marked polyester. A 3/16 inch glue area is enough. Make sure the end at the base is adjacent to the rivet and that the other end need only just cover the end of the reed window. You have to keep in mind that the inside valves are just about no clearance from the wood in many instances.\" Plastic ventilli do not curl over time, and seldom need to be replaced unless damaged by careless handling. Even accordions using plastic ventilli on most of their reeds usually have leathers on the largest reeds, and sometimes have composite reed valves comprised of leather with a layer of mylar over it. These are very similar to the composite leathers Ms. Bompezzo sells as an alternative to using the little metal spines (contrapelli) to stiffen the larger leathers. For more discussion of the relative merits of mylar ventilli versus leather reed valves, see the article titled \"Reed Valves - Plastic or Leather?\" Finding air leaks Most old accordions leak air somewhere, either through screw holes or cracks in the cabinet, or between the cabinet and the foundation plate, or through one of the bellows gaskets, or around one or more of the 41 treble valves and 24 bass valves, or through the switch linkage, or through the bellows themselves. Sometimes missing or broken reeds cause significant air leaks. Loose reed blocks can also waste a lot of air. Bad leathers can also increase air consumption. There are lots of possible sources of leaks, and a few small leaks can add up to a significant loss of air and accordion performance. Air leakage can make an accordion difficult to play. Leaks come in two categories, external and internal. External leaks are those that allow the bellows to fall open or closed without any keys or buttons being pressed. Internal leaks are those that only show up while the accordion is being played. They allow air to find its way to an open note valve without first having to pass through the reed that is being played. It is important to identify whether your leaks are external or internal so you know where to look and what to look for. External leaks are little holes and gaps where air passes into or out of the accordion without first having to pass through the reeds and valves. Fortunately, these are the easiest to find, as the escaping air can usually be heard and felt. The most common places to find external leaks are at the bellows gaskets, around loose or missing screws, shoulder strap brackets, or switch linkages, through damaged or misaligned treble and bass valves, and through loose or missing bellows corners. Bellows gaskets are easy to change, and loose screws can easily be tightened. Small holes in the wood can be quickly sealed with reed wax. Leaking valves can be simple to repair, but in some cases can be time consuming, especially for leaking bass valves because they are so hard to access. A single leaking bellows corner can be easy to fix, but if more than a couple of corners are leaking, you probably need a new bellows. Internal leaks only show themselves while a valve is open, that is, while the accordion is being played. The bellows can seem nice and tight while no keys are depressed, but the accordion consumes too much air when you play it. Sometimes these leaks can be heard as a hissing sound while a note is sounding, but their air streams can never be felt, as they are inside the accordion. The most common causes of internal leaks are bad or missing leathers, bent or broken reed tongues, loose reed plates, and loose or warped reed blocks. Internal leaks are often more time consuming to locate and repair. To find out if your leak is internal or external, measure the amount of time it takes the bellows to close under its own weight from the full open position with all valves closed. Rest your accordion on its feet on a sturdy table. Unsnap the bellows straps, grip one end of the treble keyboard in each hand, press a few keys on each end, and lift the treble section to expand the bellows. Don't mind the discordant sound as air rushes into the bellows through the random combination of open valves. Keep lifting until the bellows is all the way open and the bass section lifts off the table. Shake it a bit to make sure the bellows is fully extended, then release all the keys so all valves are closed (but don\u2019t drop the accordion). Note the time on a clock with a sweep second hand and let the bellows close by itself under the full weight of the treble section. Don't let go, but don't hold any weight, either. Use your hands to keep the bellows going down straight, but not to hold it open or force it closed. If the bellows takes less than 35 seconds to close, it has some external air leaks, as nearly all accordions do. If it takes less than 20 seconds to close, then you probably have an external leak large enough to easily locate and repair. If it takes between 20 and 35 seconds to collapse, the leaks will be much harder to find unless you use a sensitive microphone and amplifier to listen for them, as described in the article after this one titled \"The Superstar Accordion Leak Detector\". To find the source of the leak without such a microphone, expand the bellows exactly as before, but this time as the bellows slowly closes under its own weight, pass your face around the exterior, feeling for drafts of air on your cheeks. Turn the accordion around and repeat the process until you have passed your face around the entire perimeter of both bellows gaskets. The skin on your face is very sensitive to tiny drafts, and most external leaks of any consequence can be found in this manner. To verify that you have found the exact source of the leak, put a small piece of masking tape over the suspected source and repeat the test. If the leak can no longer be felt, then you can be pretty sure it is under the tape. If no leaks are found around the bellows, remove the treble grille and repeat the process to check for leaks around the treble valves. You can often isolate a single leaking valve by pressing it down lightly with your finger. If this stops the leak, you have found the source. You may be able to see that this valve does not rest flat on the foundation plate, or that it is not centered over its ports. If it appears to be centered, then the leak may be due to it being slightly tipped one way or another, or due to it being warped. You can use a narrow strip of paper as a feeler gauge to feel under both sides, both ends, and the center of the valve to be sure that each end, each side, and the center of the valve are all closing tightly against the foundation plate. Another way to find treble valve leaks is to open the accordion, remove the treble reed blocks, make sure all the switch slides are open, and in a dark room pass a bright light around the reed block side of the foundation plate while you look for glowing felt pads on the valve side of the plate. Any glowing felt represents a probable air leak. Pass the bright light around this side: While looking for glowing felt on this side: (You're right, these are two different accordions, and you would put the missing key back in before performing the test, but you get the idea.) Be aware, though, that on some accordions, mostly the very old ones from the 1930s and earlier, removing the reed blocks sometimes allows the foundation plate to flex, which can give false results on this test. That is, the valves that appear to be leaking under the bright light may not actually leak when the reed blocks are re-installed and the foundation plate is once again stiffened by their presence. Alternatively, the valves might pass the light test, but leak when the reed blocks are put back in, due to distortion of the foundation plate. However, on most newer accordions, this test works very well. This same test can be performed on the bass valves, but the bass machine must first be removed, and in the vast majority of accordions, this requires disassembling it piece by piece, a very time consuming project. An easier way to check bass valves for leaks (especially if the leather valve facings are light colored) is to remove the bass reed blocks and look at the valves from the inside. Gently press each valve open with a pencil eraser or other small blunt tool, and look for dust trails around the edges of the leather. The edges of the valves, where the nap of the leather has been flattened by contact with the foundation plate, should be clean. Dirty looking leather along these edges is an indication of a chronic air leak. You may also find wood splinters, wax chips, or other foreign matter lodged under the valve, preventing it from sealing against the foundation plate, in which case you can probably cure the problem by removing the obstruction with a pair of tweezers. This one was an easy fix: Sometimes, many individually imperceptible leaks in the bellows can add up to a significant external air leak. In this case, the only remedy is a new bellows. However, this is fairly unusual, so eliminate all the other possible leak sources before committing to a new bellows. For the ultimate in external leak detection, see the article titled \"The Superstar Accordion Leak Detector\". If your timed bellows collapse test reveals no significant external air leaks, but the accordion uses too much air when you play it, then you probably have an internal leak. To evaluate those, you will need to open the accordion. When you have it open, check first for bad leathers and broken, loose, or missing reeds. There may be some problems that you can't see, that will show up only on a test bellows, but don't worry about that right now, just look for obvious problems. If lots of leathers are curled way back from their reed plates, replacing them may significantly decrease the accordion's air consumption. If one or more reeds are loose or have fallen out, re-waxing them may solve the problem. Can you spot the missing reeds and the bad leathers in this accordion? Also check for loose reed blocks. If they move at all when you try to wiggle them, they are too loose, and simply tightening their mounting latch screw and/or installing a thin shim under the reed block restraint at the opposite end could cure the problem. In the photo below, the two screws in the top of each reed block are for securing the slide latch in locked position. The single screw immediately to the right of each reed block is for adjusting the downward pressure on the reed block. This screw should be snug enough to prevent the reed block from rocking or sliding around, but not so tight that pressure on the reed blocks distorts the foundation plate. If the slide latch end of the reed block seems tight enough, but the other end seems loose, add paper or card stock shims as shown below. Add enough shims for a snug fit, but not enough to cause the slide latch end of the reed block to rise off the foundation plate. A drop of glue will hold your shims in place. If you find no obvious problem, then diagnosing and repairing the internal air leak could take some time. There may be warped reed blocks allowing air to pass under their edges and directly to the open valve ports without first passing through the desired reeds. You can check for this by placing the reed block on a perfectly flat table and using a .003\" metal feeler gauge to check for clearance between the table and the bottom of the reed block. If you find clearance at one corner or in the middle, the rest of the reed block will have to be sanded down to eliminate this clearance. Before sanding, however, you should move the reed block around on the table to make sure that irregularities in the table surface are not responsible for the clearance. There might be reeds deformed by excessive pressure during tuning (you will be able to see a slight arch in the reed tongue), or there might be reeds that need to be properly voiced (you will notice that they respond slowly, and/or that they hiss before beginning to sound their notes). Air might be leaking through cracks in the reed wax or around reed plates that have separated from the wax but have not yet fallen out. Even if the wax looks good, it might not seal to the wood separating two reed chambers, allowing air to leak from one reed chamber to the next. I have even found holes in the wood separations between adjacent reed chambers that allow air to leak from one to another. You can use your test bellows to check for these problems. The superstar accordion leak detector One of the most time consuming aspects of accordion repair is locating air leaks. While large external leaks can be found by ear and/or by feeling the air stream on your face, finding them is often a two person job. Moreover, many external leaks including treble valve leaks are often difficult to feel, or even to hear, yet significantly impact performance, and down in the tone chamber they can be especially hard to locate. Bass valve leaks are hard to locate because you can\u2019t get sufficiently close to them without first dismantling the bass machine. Then there is the problem of being certain that you have found and repaired all the other leaks in the accordion so you can confidently tell your customer that the remaining air loss is definitely in the bellows, where we often suspect, but cannot prove, that tiny leaks at each of the bellows corners, while individually undetectable, are adding up to to a big loss of air. All these problems are instantly solved by using a miniature electret condenser microphone and amplifier with headphone. This device makes finding leaks a one person job. More importantly, it makes even the tiniest leak literally roar into the headphones. I use a 4mm diameter unidirectional electret condenser microphone element with a compact pre-amp and amplifier circuit designed for me by Alan Polivka to run on a 9-volt battery. I squeezed it all, including circuit board, battery, microphone jack, volume control, and on/off switch, into a 2 1/8\u201d x 3 1/4\u201d x 1 1/4\u201d (54 mm x 83 mm x 32 mm) plastic box that clips onto my pocket. A cheap stereo headphone completes the assembly. Mounting the tiny and fragile microphone element into one end of a 6-inch (15 cm) length of 3/16\u201d (5 mm) o.d. pvc tubing protects it from damage, yet still allows putting it down into some very tight places. Just use a 4 mm drill bit to enlarge about \u00bc inch (6 mm) of one end of the tube to snugly fit the 4 mm microphone element. A squirt of hot glue from a glue gun into the opposite end of the pvc tube holds the microphone wires firmly in place and eliminates any chance of pulling them off the microphone element during normal use. The elasticity of this pvc wand acoustically isolates the microphone from your hand, thereby minimizing the noise caused by gripping the wand with your fingers or by rubbing it against parts of the accordion, thus eliminating the main annoyance of using a stethoscope, which tends to roar anytime you move it. This little microphone reaches into places a medical stethoscope won\u2019t go, and is far more sensitive to air flow. It fits down between treble valve rods to listen right alongside each treble valve, including those in the tone chamber. It reaches down through the pistons of the bass machine to listen alongside individual bass valves, bass register slide pivots, and other foundation plate penetrations. Unlike lengthening a stethoscope hose or adding slimmer tubular extensions to reach int tight places, lengthening the microphone cord or wand does not decrease its sensitivity. It is great for listening around cabinetry joints and foundation plate edges in behind the treble valve rods and around the bass cabinet, as well as around the bellows gaskets and external screws. It allows you to find smaller leaks than are detectable by any other means, including a stethoscope. Repairing even these seemingly minor leaks can significantly extend bellows collapse time, thus improving accordion performance and gaining you happier customers. The attached photo, circuit diagram, and parts list should allow you to build your own Superstar Accordion Leak Detector for about $60 in parts and supplies, including the headset and battery, plus the cost of shipping components from several sources. Unless you are an experienced electronics technician, I recommend that you purchase more than one microphone element ($2 each), because of the high likelihood of destroying them during construction (I ruined 4 out of 10). For someone new to electronic assembly (like me), the challenges involved in the construction include laying out the circuit board elements to fit on such a small board, laying out the board and all the other components to fit into such a small box, soldering wire leads to the tiny pins on the back of the microphone element (best done under 10x magnification) without overheating it or shorting it, and getting the microphone element and its new leads safely mounted in the pvc tube without ripping the leads off the microphone in the process. Challenging as it is, the convenience of the tiny amplifier and the astonishing effectiveness of this mini microphone at finding accordion leaks make it all worthwhile. If you do much accordion repair, you will soon wonder how you ever survived without this little gem.

It is even more annoying if it is in a place that causes an air leak. Sometimes you can get away with using the next larger diameter screw, but sometimes that is not practical, in which case you must fill the hole and start over. This simple procedure also comes in handy whenever you want to fill an old hole after moving some bracket, strap, or snap to a new location. If the hole is small enough, you can use a round or square wooden toothpick (the flat ones do not work well) as a plug. If the hole is too large for a toothpick, use a small softwood dowel, available at the building supply store for under a dollar. Whatever your chosen plug, make it longer than the depth of the hole you are filling, because you will want to trim it off flush later. If using a toothpick, trim off part of the point as required for a slightly snug fit in the hole, then shave the rest of it down to that same diameter. If using a dowel, either shave it down to fit the hole or ream the hole larger for a slightly snug fit around the dowel. Work from the outside, but check on the inside to be sure the plug or the glue you will use will not interfere with anything on that side. Use a wooden toothpick to coat the inside of the hole and the outside of the plug with Elmer's wood glue. Push the plug into the hole until it bottoms out or, if the hole goes all the way through, until it is flush with the wood on the other side. Let the glue dry for several hours. When the glue has dried, trim the plug flush with the surface with a single edge razor. If you plan to install a new screw in the hole, use a tiny drill bit (no more than 2/3 the diameter of the screw) to drill a pilot hole. If your new screw is smaller than the smallest drill bit you can get, then try using the point of an awl, or perhaps even a straight pin or sewing needle to make the pilot hole. Getting the new screw started in a pilot hole will ensure that it enters the wood precisely where you want it, and also helps prevent the new screw from stripping out as you drive it in. If you don't plan to install a new screw in the hole, and if you wish to repair the celluloid finish at the hole's location, then snip the plug flush with the surface before the glue dries and use another piece of dowel to force the plug a bit farther into the hole so it ends up very slightly below the surrounding surface. Then use black fingernail polish (or some other matching colour if your accordion is not black) very sparingly just on top of the plug, being careful not to get it on the surrounding celluloid. Don't try to fill the hole with fingernail polish all at once. It is better to build it up in thin layers after each preceding layer dries. When you finally have the fingernail polish flush with the surface, stop. If you have kept the fingernail polish confined to the diameter of the hole, your repair will be small and inconspicuous and will not need further finishing. Replacing a bellows gasket If you have a leak at one of your bellows gaskets, replace the gasket. Pull the bellows pins, split the accordion, and determine whether the gasket is located on the bellows or on the cabinet. The old gasket is likely to be leather, mounted in a 3/16 to 1/4 inch wide shallow channel on the bellows frame, but is sometimes mounted on the treble or bass cabinet. With time, the leather shrinks, the cabinet warps, the bellows frame warps, or the bellows pins loosen up. Whatever the cause, the leather is no longer able to make a good seal. Peel it off and use a narrow flat blade screwdriver or similar scraping tool to remove the residue and the old glue. Take care not to damage the plastic trim bead that usually forms the outer wall of the shallow channel. Replacement gaskets are adhesive backed foam rubber. This material is a bit thicker and more resilient than the original leather, and will seal better. It is available in long rolls in two different widths (3/16\" and 1/4\") from FRM Enterprises in Montreal for $12 or $13 per roll. A roll is enough for several accordions. Just get the roll width that matches your old gasket, cut off what you need, peel off a few inches of one end of the paper backing protecting the adhesive, and press the gasket into place, taking care to keep it properly aligned and lying flat in the channel, peeling off the backing as you go. Try to make the gasket all one piece in order to minimize the chances of a leak at one of the end joints. I begin and end with a steep bevel cut across the gasket to allow a long side by side lap joint where the two ends join. This eliminates the need to cut the new gasket quite as precisely to the correct length. However, simply butting the square cut ends snugly together will suffice, if you get the length cut exactly right. As you round the corners on your bellows frame, stretch it a bit to fit the curve and press it firmly into place a fraction of an inch at a time to ensure a good fit and stable anchorage around the corner. If the gasket surface is double or triple wide along the front of the bass section by the bass switches, simply cut and fit additional strips of the gasket snugly against one another as required to fill the space to the same extent that it was filled by the original gasket. You will occasionally find that the new gasket material is not thick enough to seal the joint. In that case, try applying a second gasket over the first one. If you can get the bellows pins in without excessive force, this double gasket will probably solve the problem. However, if the double gasket turns out to be too thick, that is, if there is danger that forcing the bellows pins into place will enlarge the holes or perhaps split the bellows frame, then peel it all off and start over, looking for a different solution. Check the mating surfaces of the bellows frame and accordion cabinet for warpage with a straight edge. If identifiable high spots are found, sanding them down may provide sufficient room for the double gasket. Also look for screws, brackets, internal microphones, wires, etc. that might be preventing the bellows frame from uniformly and snugly contacting the mating surface in the cabinet. In extreme cases you might lay in a second layer of gasket just where the single thickness gasket continues to leak, thus avoiding excessive pressure on the bellows pins in the areas where a single gasket is thick enough. If you have the thickness just right, when you put the accordion back together you should have to slightly compress the new gasket by pressing down lightly on the treble section in order to allow the bellows pins to be pushed into place with moderate pressure. If they go in too tightly, they might damage the bellows frame. If they go in too loosely, the gasket may still leak. You will be rewarded for getting it right because few things are better than a nice airtight accordion. Repairing cracked or broken wood You will probably eventually encounter an accordion with a cracked cabinet, perhaps from being dropped. The most common crack is under the bass cover around the bass cover mounting screws, where the rather fragile wood structure sometimes cracks along a line between the two screws at one end of the cover, so the screws won\u2019t hold. Another fairly common crack is in the wood supporting the lower end of the bass machine, or between the slots in the wooden bass piston guide at the bottom of the pistons. The worst kind of crack is at the corners of the treble cabinet where it joins the bellows, because not only does air leak through the crack, but the resulting loose fit around the bellows frame often causes the bellows gasket to leak, as well. The good news is that nearly all these cracks are repairable, but I have seen some pretty shoddy failed attempts to glue and tape these things together, so I think it might be useful to review the correct way to repair cracked or broken wood. The first rule is that the crack must be glued and clamped. Just pouring glue into the crack will not suffice, as it will create a very weak joint certain to crack open again, probably immediately. For a strong glue joint, the glue must be in a very thin coat over a fairly large area of contact between the two sides of the crack, and allowed to cure overnight under clamping pressure, with the two sides of the crack pressed firmly and tightly together by the clamps. The second rule is that you must have your clamps ready ahead of time so you can set them immediately after you glue the joint. After you have brushed on the glue is not the time to go searching for clamps, nor is it the time to discover that the clamps you have selected will not fit or will not hold, or will not stay in place on a curved surface. All the details of the clamping must be worked out in advance, and the clamps actually installed and tightened before you glue anything, just to make sure it will all work as planned. Once you have proven that your clamping arrangement works, remove the clamps, spread Elmer's wood glue in the joint, and reapply the clamps. Sometimes even this will not hold, especially if the wood is thin and the pressure forcing the crack open is great. Such is the case with cracks at the corner of the treble cabinet where it joins the bellows. The plywood wrap around these corners of the treble cabinet is very thin to allow the bellows frame to fit snugly down inside the cabinet, so the faces on either side of the crack are very small, not affording enough contact area to provide a structurally strong joint if simply glued and clamped. Whenever a simple glued joint will not suffice, you will have to fabricate some kind of doubler across the joint. If it is a wooden doubler or a corner gusset, it, too must be glued and clamped in place after the crack itself is clamped securely closed by its own set of clamps. If there is not room for a wooden doubler or gusset of sufficient thickness and strength (such as at the corners of the treble cabinet facing the bellows), you can fabricate an aluminium corner bracket and glue and screw it in place. In this case, the screws are merely clamps that are left permanently in place. Naturally, the bellows frame will have to be mortised to fit around the aluminium corner bracket, or the bellows frame will not fit back into the treble cabinet. No two cracks are the same, so it is impossible to write detailed instructions that will apply in every case, but walking you through a repair I recently made will help illustrate the basic procedure, and may provide some ideas for repairing the next crack you encounter. Clamping a rounded corner may seem daunting at first, because the usual spring clamps and screw clamps will not fit. But if you are creative, you will figure out some way to clamp it. I used a one inch wide nylon cargo strap around the cabinet, tightened by the little hand winch that comes with the strap. I modified the strap to eliminate the steel hooks, which I feared would mar the accordion finish. I ground off the rivet and removed and discarded the short strap with its hook. Then I removed the hook from the long strap and anchored one end of that strap to the winch with a bolt and nut to replace the rivet I had ground off. I wound the other end of the strap around the spool of the winch and used the winch to tighten the strap around the treble cabinet until the cracked corners closed. Naturally, I had to first remove the bellows strap snaps and shoulder strap brackets to allow the cargo strap to fit snugly against the celluloid finish. I used a soft rag as a pad to protect the celluloid finish from being marred by the metal winch. I found a short piece of scrap aluminium tubing with the same outside radius as the inside radius of the treble cabinet corners. I cut the short length of tubing into quarters, circumference-wise, so each of my corner brackets started out as a 90 degree curve. I trimmed these down to maybe 70 or 80 degree curves on my belt sander, as I wanted them just wide enough to allow getting my screws into solid wood on either side of the crack. I used a centre-punch to locate four holes in each of them, then used my drill press to drill those holes to match the outside diameter of the small brass wood screws I had on hand, which were short enough not to go all the way through the wood. I then used a countersink mounted in the drill press to countersink the heads of the flathead screws flush with the aluminium, so they would not interfere with the bellows frame. With the cargo strap tightened to completely close the cracks, I held the new brackets in place on the accordion with small spring clamps while I used the brackets as templates to drill tiny pilot holes in the wood. After drilling the first pilot hole for each bracket, I put a screw in it to hold the bracket firmly in place while I drilled the rest of them. I wrapped masking tape around my pilot hole drill bit to use as a depth gauge to avoid drilling all the way through to the outside finish, and I drilled by hand, holding and turning the drill chuck with my fingers. Using just two screws to hold each corner bracket in place, I set the bellows in place, marked the bellows frame at the edges of both corner brackets, and used a box cutter to hand carve mortises in the bellows frame corners to accommodate the thickness of the new corner brackets. I removed the corner brackets from the cabinet to use as templates to carve the bellows frame corner to exactly the right curvature and depth for a snug fit. Note that all this was in preparation. Nothing had been glued yet. I released the cargo strap, cut small pieces of waxed paper to fit between the strap and the outside face of the accordion at the cracks, to prevent any glue that might squeeze out of the crack from gluing the strap to the accordion. Only then did I put glue into both cracks, using a narrow piece of .002\u201d metal feeler gauge to work the glue thoroughly down into the bottoms of the cracks. Once I was sure that the entire inside faces of the cracks were thoroughly coated, I put the waxed paper in place and tightened the cargo strap until the cracks were once again completely closed, forcing most of the glue out of the crack. With the cargo strap still firmly tight, I then brushed glue onto the aluminium corner brackets and onto the wood behind them, and installed the screws to clamp them in place. I let the whole thing dry undisturbed overnight. In the morning I released the cargo strap and reinstalled the reed blocks, shoulder strap brackets, bellows strap snaps, and bellows. What the previous day had been a worthless, unplayable, cracked and leaky mess, was now a perfectly playable accordion. I scraped just enough glue out of the cracks to make room for a few thin layers of black nail polish to colour the repair to match the accordion finish. What had been 1/8\u201d wide gaping cracks were now almost invisible. It was a very satisfying repair. Installing a back pad One of the easiest and most economical ways to enhance the look and feel of your accordion is to install a back pad, which helps protect the bellows from your clothing and vise-versa. Back pads are normally held on by four snaps. The female halves of the snaps are usually pre-mounted in the back pad, and the male halves of the snaps and the screws for attaching them to the back of the treble keyboard are usually supplied loose with the pad. Make sure the supplied screws are not longer than necessary to penetrate the snap and the wood, as you do not want the screw point interfering with the action of any of the treble keys on the other side. Set the accordion on its feet and position the pad where you want it. Make sure you have the right size pad, as they come in various sizes. The pad should not be so large that it sticks out past either end of the accordion, and it should probably be at least large enough to reach within one inch of either end. I like mine to reach just about to the beginning of the curve on the bellows corners. In the other direction, I like my back pads to extend about an inch past the bass side of the bellows, but many are installed flush with the bass side of the bellows; it\u2019s your choice. You can slide it up or down to suit yourself. Although they are typically installed within an inch or so of the edge of the keyboard, this is not critical, as this part of the accordion does not move much relative to your clothing. Make sure the pad is square with the accordion, then place a one inch square of doubled or tripled masking tape approximately cantered under each of the snaps. You will use these to mark the exact locations for the screw holes. You are doubling it to allow you to make a better impression of the snap in the thicker, more compressible multiple thickness tape. Start by marking just one screw location on the tape. Choose a drill bit no larger than 2/3 the diameter of your screw, and drill the pilot hole very carefully so as not to punch through the thin wood and damage one of the keys on the other side. I drill by hand, using a drill bit and chuck only (no drill motor). The wood is soft and not very thick, so several twists of the drill under moderate pressure should be enough to drill your pilot hole through the tape and the wood. Twist one of your screws partway into the hole to begin cutting the threads, then back it out, remove the tape, put the male snap in place and install the screw. Snug is enough. Don\u2019t over-tighten it, or you may strip the threads out of the thin wood. Snap the back pad onto that snap, position it square with the accordion, and press one of the other snaps hard against its masking tape pad to make a circular impression in the tape. Mark the centre of this circular impression with a pen or pencil, and drill your pilot hole through the mark. Tap the threads and install the snap just as you did with the first one. Repeat with each of the two remaining snaps.","title":"Accordion Repair 1"},{"location":"accordion-repair1/#accordion-repair-is-not-rocket-science","text":"In fact, accordions are very low tech. You don\u2019t need fancy tools or expensive electronic instruments to fix your accordion. A sophisticated super-accurate electronic tuner, once a $300 to $500 item, can now be had for just a few dollars at the iPad/iPhone App Store, assuming you already have an iPad or iPhone (download \"n-Track Tuner Pro\"). But you don't even need that for most repairs. Nearly everything you will need to do can be done with standard tools you can get at the hardware store and a few special tools you can easily make from steel or aluminium rods or in some cases, from hardwood. If you have a hack saw, a bench vice, a bench grinder, a small drill press, a belt sander, and a couple of files, you can make all the special tools you need. The articles posted here on how to make specific types of repairs also include instructions on how to make the required tools. The most important things you need to repair your accordion are motivation, mechanical aptitude, some hand tools, a work table, a little coaching from someone with experience (like me), and good sources for the correct repair materials. Mechanical aptitude is really nothing more than the desire to fix things, the ability to remember or record how they came apart, common sense, and perseverance. The hand tools you need for simple repairs are pretty basic. To get any accordion apart and the reed blocks out, all you need are a screw driver and a pair of pliers (the best kind is a bellows pin pliers that you can make yourself from an inexpensive end-cutter pliers - see the short article below). For the most common repair, changing reed leathers, you will find a normally closed tweezers (the kind you have to squeeze to open) indispensable. You will also need a razor to cut reed leathers to the proper length. Your work table should be big enough to allow you to spread out the three major components of the accordion (treble cabinet, bass cabinet, and bellows) and still have room to work on a reed block or two. Good lighting is essential, and an LED headlight (that straps onto your forehead) is essential for looking into tight places. Your work table should also include a tuning bellows, which you can easily make from an old accordion bellows. See the article on making a test bellows.","title":"Accordion repair is not rocket science."},{"location":"accordion-repair1/#how-to-make-a-bellows-pin-pliers","text":"Modify a pair of cheap end-cutters (pliers with the cutting jaws across the end, rather than along one side) by filing two round holes centered where the two cutting jaws meet. The pliers can be cheap imports because you are ruining the cutting edges anyway. Make one hole about 3/16\" in diameter for large bass pins, and make one 3/32\" in diameter for small pins. I used round files of each size chucked into my drill press, and squeezed the pliers onto the spinning file until I had the hole I wanted. Here is a photo of the pliers I made.","title":"How to make a bellows pin pliers"},{"location":"accordion-repair1/#opening-the-accordion","text":"It is best to remove the shoulder straps and the back pad (if any) before opening the accordion. Once that is done, locate and count the bellows pins on the treble side of the bellows. There will usually be three or four on the back and three or four on the front, but there may also be one on the top and one on the bottom. Avoid marring the pins or the plastic finish on the accordion when you pull the pins. If you don't have the special pliers made for this purpose, you can wrap the jaws of any pliers with tape to pad them. Stand the accordion on its feet, that is, with the bass plate and bass strap down. Grip each treble side bellows pin with the pliers and pull it straight out, steadying the accordion with your other hand as you do so. Some accordions have screws in place of the pins, in which case you will spin them out with a screwdriver. Keep the screws and/or pins in order, as they are often not all exactly the same length or diameter, and they should be put back into the same holes they came from. (To keep them in order, I stab them into a Styrofoam block in the same order in which they are to be reinstalled, front pins in the front of the block, rear pins in the rear.) When you have removed all the pins from the treble side of the bellows, try lifting one corner of the treble section off the bellows. You may have to hold the bellows down while you pull up on the treble section. If you meet significant resistance, check for any bellows strap or snap mounting screws within a half inch of the bellows that might be penetrating the bellows frame and remove them also. Forcing the accordion apart while any screw or pin still penetrates the bellows frame can damage the bellows frame, necessitating a costly repair. In lieu of bellows pins, some aluminum bodied Hohner accordions have two lever latches under the treble grille that release the treble side from the bellows. On those models, remove the grille, rotate the levers 180 degrees, and lift the front of the treble cabinet off the bellows, then disengage the hinge clips at the back. Do not remove the screws along the back. To separate the bellows from the bass side of these accordions, first remove the bass cover, then release the two thumb clips and remove the bass machine and bass button board as an assembly, and finally, remove the five screws that fasten the bass cabinet to the bellows. The bass cabinet can the be lifted free of the bellows. When the treble section first separates from the bellows, peek inside to see if any internal microphone wires must be disconnected before lifting it far enough to tear those wires loose from their mounting, which is often very fragile. Once the wires are unplugged, turn the treble section over and set it on the table with the reed blocks facing upward. Now you can inspect for bad leathers, cracked wax, missing reeds, loose reed blocks, etc. If your accordion has no tone chamber, the treble side will look something like this: If it has a tone chamber, it will look like this: The bass side, with the bellows attached, looks like this: For better access to the bass reed blocks, remove the bellows from the bass section as well, but not before noting how it goes back together. If there are four bellows pins on the front of the bass section and three on the back, then it will be obvious which way the bellows goes back on. If it is not obvious, then mark the bellows frame with a pencil so you can be sure to put it back in the correct orientation, or the bellows frame will not seal and your bellows pins will not line up. Be sure to unplug any microphone wires before lifting the bellows too far. If you are removing reed blocks, be very careful not to bend the register slides. In many older accordions, the slides are mounted in the reed block rather than in the foundation plate. If this is the case, lifting the reed block without first disengaging the slide from the switch mechanism can cause the slide to kink, rendering it useless. Once bent, they are very difficult or impossible to straighten well enough to work properly. Note the orientation of the reed blocks and the details of the slide\u2019s connection to the linkage so you will be able to put it back exactly the way it came out. When reinstalling any reed block, make sure it is securely and rigidly fastened down so no air can leak under it. When you have finished your interior inspection, set the bellows back onto the bass section (being careful not to snag any bass reed leathers in the process), reconnecting any microphone wires as you go, and install the bass side bellows pins. Then set the treble section in place on the bellows, reconnecting any microphone wires as you go and making sure you have the bass buttons and treble keys all facing forward. Install the bellows pins in their proper holes. If the pins are hard to push in, you can save wear and tear on your fingers by pushing them in with a small block of wood. However, if you have to push very hard, you may have the wrong pin in the wrong hole, or something misaligned. Make sure you have the best fit for all pins before forcing any pin into any hole. Finally, reinstall any bellows strap screws you may have removed, and put on the shoulder straps and back pad. Access to the bass machine is easiest while the treble side is removed from the bellows, because this allows you to set the bass half of the accordion down on its bellows with the bass cover facing up. If you don\u2019t take the treble side off, it is hard to stabilize the accordion in this position unless you use an accordion stand, a simple frame that keeps the accordion from tipping over or sliding away while you remove the bass cover. You can make it out of scrap lumber and a few drywall screws. I used 1 x 1 boards I ripped from some recycled 1 x 4, but you can make yours from just about anything. You might want to pad it with felt, foam rubber, or carpet to help protect the finish on your accordion. Usually, you remove the bass strap by backing off the large knurled nut until that end of the strap comes loose. Many really old accordions have the strap screwed directly to the bass cabinet, in which case you simply remove the screws. Others have a pair of machine screws mounted in the bass cabinet (threaded ends facing upward) that engage holes in the bass strap. In this case, a rectangular washer and small knurled nuts on those machine screws clamp the strap in place, so just remove the nuts and washer. It is usually not necessary to disconnect the other end of the bass strap. Just pull the strap out of your way to get access to the bass cover fasteners. The bass cover is usually held on by four screws near the corners, but sometimes just two screws, top and bottom, and sometimes with some sort of spring clips or sliding pins or push-button releases, and no screws at all. Watch out for very tiny countersunk wood screws along the edges of the bass cover, especially near the center of the front edge. If there are any, you definitely want to remove them before pulling the bass cover off. Once you have the cover off, you can see the bass machine. When you put the bass cover back on, be sure to guide the air release button through its hole in the bass cover before you install any of the screws. Here is a typical bass machine:","title":"Opening the accordion"},{"location":"accordion-repair1/#why-replace-old-leathers","text":"Proper accordion maintenance includes periodically checking the reed leathers and replacing any not in perfect shape. What is perfect shape, you say? Well, every leather should be soft and pliable and should return to position tight against the reed plate after each use. Reed leathers are small leather check valves mounted on the reed plates. There are two on each reed plate - one on the side facing into the reed block and one on the side facing outward, that is, out into the bellows. Their function is to prevent bellows air from leaking through the reed vents (slots over which the reed tongues are mounted) not in use. Leathers should close under their own power whenever they are not forced open by air coming through the reed vent behind them. When the bellows is expanding (bass section moving outward), the reed tongues on the inside of the reed block are in use, as air is drawn into the accordion through any open note valves. The leathers on the inside of the reed block adjacent to those reed tongues close off the adjacent reed vents to prevent air from leaking into the bellows through those vents and through the reed tongues behind them on the outside of the reed block. When the bellows is being compressed (bass section traveling inward), the air flow is reversed, bringing the reed tongues on the outside face of the reed block into play. In this case the leathers on the outside of the reed block remain closed to prevent air from leaking out past the reed tongues on the inside of the reed block. Air rushing out of the accordion through any open note valves forces the interior leathers on those particular reeds to open, while the higher pressure within the compressing bellows forcefully closes the leathers on the outside of the reed block. If leathers hang open too far, say 1/4 inch or more, they may not close at all, resulting in a significant air leak, and throwing the adjacent reed tongues out of tune. This can make you think your accordion needs tuning, but simply replacing the bad leathers will probably bring it back into tune. If leathers hang open between 1/4 and 1/8 inch, they may eventually close, but only after their adjacent reeds have begun to sound. Those reeds will initially sound out of tune until their leathers close, at which time they will suddenly jump back into tune, resulting in an audible pitch change shortly after the reed begins to sound. Leathers hanging just slightly open, say 1/8 inch or less, will be forced closed by air pressure before the adjacent reeds begin to sound, but not before some air has leaked through the vents they are supposed to seal. This leaking air momentarily relieves the pressure on the adjacent reed tongues, slightly delaying their response. Even though these marginally bad reed leathers may not sound bad, they will sap your accordion's performance, causing your reeds to respond more slowly and causing the accordion to use more air than necessary. To get the best performance out of your accordion, you should keep all the leathers in perfect shape. Some people pay thousands of dollars extra for accordions with handmade reeds because handmade reeds respond just a bit more quickly at low bellows pressures, significantly improving accordion performance. You may be able to get a similar increase in performance for much less money simply by replacing all your bad leathers.","title":"Why replace old leathers?"},{"location":"accordion-repair1/#how-to-make-a-test-bellows","text":"You can make a simple test bellows from an old accordion bellows and two pieces of plank or plywood. If the bellows frame has already been cut off your old bellows, as would be the case if this bellows had been replaced by a new one, simply cut two pieces of 1/2 inch plywood to fit over each open end of the bellows and glue them on. Make sure your glue joints are air tight. To facilitate anchoring it to your work bench with screws, bolts, or clamps, make these wooden end caps slightly larger than the outside dimensions of the bellows. A one inch margin all around should be sufficient. If your bellows still has its wooden bellows frame attached, as would be the case if the bellows had simply been salvaged from a junk accordion, you can use wood screws to attach your end plates to the bellows frames, then seal the joints with hot reed wax. Alternatively, you can put foam weatherstripping or gasket material between the bellows frame and the end plate before screwing it together. This latter solution makes the most sense if you are going to put weights inside. If you prefer not to anchor the bottom end plate to your work table, you can add enough weight inside to hold it down while you are lifting the top plate to expand the bellows. A couple of bricks or a big box of bolts or a bag of sand placed inside the bellows should do the trick. Make a hole near the center of the top plate approximately the same size as the holes in the bottoms of each chamber in a reed block, about 1/2 inch in diameter. A hole this size will minimize the need to silence adjacent reeds in order to hear just the one you want to test, and is best if you will be using your test bellows just to check the operation of reeds and leathers. However, if you will be tuning, it is essential that the hole in the bottom of the reed block be consistently placed completely over the hole in the top of the test bellows. In that case, a larger, rectangular hole is best. The hole on my tuning bellows (not the one shown below) is 7/16\" wide (parallel to the rail) x 3/4\" long. The drawback to larger holes is that air sometimes feeds to multiple reeds, forcing you to silence all but the one you want to test. Glue a piece of leather to the top plate, fuzzy side up, centered around this hole. You might also choose to fasten a small wooden rail or metal angle about 1/4 inch away from the hole to facilitate properly aligning the reed block over the hole. If you have made a larger rectangular hole, you can place the rail a bit closer, say 1/8\" from the hole. If you scribe index marks on the rail aligned with the edges of the hole, it will be easy to see whether you have it centered. To use the test bellows, place the reed block on the top plate with the hole on the bottom of the reed chamber of the reed you wish to sound aligned with the hole in the top plate. If the hole in the top plate is large enough to also sound the reed on the opposite side of the reed block, you can silence it with a piece of fabric or leather squeezed against it with the fingers of the hand holding the reed block in position. Your other hand will be used to raise and lower one end of the test bellows to force air over the selected reed. When using your test bellows for tuning, be aware that the pressures are reversed relative to those inside the accordion. Compressing the test bellows generates higher pressure air to drive the reed tongue on the inside of the reed block, while on the accordion, the higher pressure air resulting from bellows compression drives the reed tongue on the outside of he reed block. Thus, on the test bellows the inner reed tongue works under higher pressure than the outer one, just the opposite of what occurs inside the accordion. Since the reed frequency is impacted by air density, which is proportional to the pressure, the frequency of both the interior and exterior reeds will be different on the test bellows than they are inside the accordion. Tuning the reeds to their proper frequencies on the test bellows will throw them out of tune in the accordion, where it really matters. The proper use of a test bellows during tuning is therefore limited to making corrections of the magnitude determined while the reed block is in the accordion. That is, if the reed plays three cents too flat in the accordion, you can use the test bellows to determine when you have sharpened it the required three cents. For instance, if on the test bellows the tuner indicates that same reed tongue is one cent too sharp, you can sharpen it until it indicates four cents too sharp, which should put it right on pitch once it is back in the accordion. Your test bellows has many uses other than tuning. You can use it to voice reeds, to find loose reeds, to find silent reeds or to verify that you have successfully cleared them, to observe reed valve (leather) operation, and, in conjunction with your tuner (or your well trained ear) to sound possible replacement reeds to determine whether they produce the note you need. Here are two photos of one I made recently. I used an old bellows cut from an accordion to allow installation of a new bellows, so the old bellows had no frames on it. I glued the bottom of the bellows directly to the bottom board, made a new bellows frame from 1 x 1 lumber, which I glued to the top of the bellows, and screwed the top board to that bellows frame with foam rubber weatherstriping sandwiched in between as an air seal. B**ecause I did not want to screw it down to my work bench, I put a bunch of heavy bolts inside, glued in place to keep them from shifting around, These can also be made without interior weights and mounted under a table, actuated downward by foot pedals and returned upward by springs, but I prefer to have mine on top so I can operate it by hand in order to feel the pressure being applied and get a better sense of how the reed is responding to that pressure. You can use your imagination to build a different design. One of the readers of this website, Chris Krasev of Milton, Ontario, submitted the following photo of an interesting one he built. As you can see, he added moveable rails and air valves made up from register slides salvaged from a junk accordion. Dennis Amott of North Vancouver, Canada, sent me a link to his YouTube video of a tuning bellows he made. If you click the link, you will see that he made a portable table top model that opens downward, so the top plate remains stationary and level as the bellows is opened, allowing it to be operated with just one hand.","title":"How to make a test bellows"},{"location":"accordion-repair1/#never-oil-your-accordion","text":"Accordions are big air filters. Lots of air is pumped through them, and the moisture, dust and lint in the air all tend to collect on interior parts, so the air emerges cleaner than it went in. This accumulation of lint in the accordion is inevitable, but oiling any part in the accordion tends to make it even worse. The oil attracts more dust and lint than before, and when enough of it combines with the oil, it makes a thick, gooey substance that can cause keys, bass buttons, and register switches and slides to stick. When you encounter a sticking key, button, switch, or slide, you may be tempted to oil it, but on accordions you should resist that temptation. The better course is to take it apart, clean it thoroughly, determine the source of friction, sand, smooth, polish, realign, or loosen parts as necessary to reduce the friction, and put it back together dry. Although oil may seem to help in the short run, in the long run you will regret using it. If you absolutely must use some lubricant, try graphite, but very sparingly, or you will have another kind of mess as the graphite spreads to areas you never intended it to go.","title":"Never oil your accordion"},{"location":"accordion-repair1/#reed-valves-plastic-or-leather","text":"Some accordions are now made with plastic reed valves (ventilli) rather than the more traditional leather. Is this an improvement in accordion quality and performance, or just a cheaper way to build an accordion? Plastic reed valves have some apparent advantages. They are lighter and more flexible, and therefore may open under less bellows pressure. If this were to allow the reed to respond more quickly, it would improve accordion performance. After all, rapid reed response is one of the highly desirable characteristics of reeds. But if the amount of air flow required to open the leather reed valve is already less than that required to sound the reed, then a valve that opens even earlier would offer no real advantage. Previous observations lead me to predict that if the plastic ventilli do offer any advantage, it will be most apparent at the higher frequency reeds. These are the smallest reeds in the accordion, which require the least air flow to sound, and which do not normally have leathers because the air flow required to sound the reed is not sufficient to force a leather valve open. Installing a leather on these small reeds significantly delays their response or silences them entirely. It is here that the plastic ventilli, if it actually opens under less pressure, would be most helpful. But it is also here that leathers are least needed, because the leakage around these tiny reeds is already very limited by their size. I therefore suspect that although plastic ventilli probably do offer some performance advantage at the higher notes, and especially on handmade reeds which require even less air to operate, the advantage is likely to be small. Plastic ventilli offer another apparent advantage. The plastic seems much less likely than leather to curl away from the reed plate, because plastic is lighter and less likely to sag, and because it is impermeable to moisture, which is reputed to be one of the major contributors to the curling of leather. However, plastic cannot duplicate one of the reputed functions of leather, which is to help keep the reeds dry by absorbing moisture from the air. The importance of this function is a matter for debate, and the question is moot in cases where the accordion is not subjected to moisture. Nevertheless, leather reed valves might have an advantage on this point. Plastic ventilli are available in more distinct lengths than leather reed valves, and thus offer time savings during installation by eliminating the need to field cut leathers to the proper length for each reed. They are also less expensive than leather, although leather reed valves cost only about ten cents each in large quantities, amounting to about $35 for a full set for a full size 41/120 4/5 accordion. So which should we use? Until I or someone else experimentally confirms that plastic noticeably improves reed performance, I will continue replacing leather with leather and plastic with plastic unless I feel the leather might be adversely impacting the response of a particular reed, in which case I will substitute a plastic ventillo.","title":"Reed valves - plastic, or leather?"},{"location":"accordion-repair1/#polishing-your-accordion","text":"Accordion manufacturers polish the celluloid finish on their accordions using large floor mounted buffing wheels and a series of successively finer abrasive buffing compounds. They do this polishing prior to attachment of grilles, straps, metal trim, etc, and before the accordion is assembled. At the polishing stage, the treble and bass cabinets are devoid of keys, buttons, reed blocks, and bellows. The operator stands in front of the rotating cloth buffing wheel, applies buffing compound to the wheel, then presses the bare accordion cabinet into it, being careful not to generate enough heat to cloud the surface of the celluloid. When he has it uniformly shiny, he switches to a different buffing wheel where a liquid polish is used for the final finish. Although few of us have large buffing wheels at our disposal, we should adopt this general approach whenever we polish our accordion, even if we polish by hand. That is, the accordion should be disassembled and the individual components polished separately. In this way we avoid leaving unsightly deposits of buffing compound under the edges of metal trim parts, at the junction of treble grille and treble cabinet, on the grille cloth at grille openings, and in between keys and buttons. This approach also allows us to polish what would otherwise be difficult to reach corners where cabinet and trim parts meet. Using buffing compound and a powered buffing wheel saves time and effort, but even fairly significant marring of the finish can be polished out by hand if you apply buffing compound in sequentially finer grades along with a lot of \"elbow grease\". For the final finish, use the micro-abrasive polishing compounds sold in auto parts stores specifically for restoring the clarity of plastic automobile head lamp lenses. Don't use so much that it flows over the surface or into little nooks and crannies where you can't get it all out. In between these major polishings, we need only wipe off the finish with a soft cloth. If the finish is really grungy, the cloth can be dampened with rubbing alcohol, but no liquid should ever be poured or sprayed onto or into your accordion. Slathering wax all over your accordion, then buffing it out like you would your car just makes a mess, due to all the angles, joints, and other irregularities in the surface. Besides, mechanically polished celluloid is naturally shiny, and does not require wax. If the finish has dulled, wax will not improve it much anyway. The marring and scratches should be mechanically buffed out just as they originally were at the factory. Special care should be taken with the keyboard. Keys can be cleaned in place using a soft cloth dampened with rubbing alcohol. But never allow any liquid to run down in between the keys. The keys and keyboard are usually made of unfinished wood. Moisture absorbed into the wood can cause local swelling and warping, which in turn can cause keys to stick. For particularly difficult key cleaning jobs, see the article on cleaning and buffing keys. The real key to keeping your accordion shiny is not to let it get dirty in the first place. If you protect it from scratches and wipe it off with a soft dry cloth or chamois each time you play, it may never need to be polished.","title":"Polishing your accordion"},{"location":"accordion-repair1/#proper-shoulder-strap-lengths","text":"Accordion shoulder straps come in mismatched pairs, that is, one strap is longer than the other. If you examine them closely, you will see that the upper portion of each is identical, and all the variation is in the tail, which connects to the bottom of the accordion. The strap on the right has the longer tail because the accordion must sit left of your center. Depending on your size and the location of the strap brackets on the accordion, the right shoulder strap might be 4 to 6 inches longer than the left when properly adjusted. When adjusting your straps, you should begin with the left one and adjust it short enough to hold the accordion suspended from your left shoulder so that the centers of the black keys on the right side of the accordion are directly under your chin, and the top of the accordion is about four inches below your chin. Then adjust the right strap long enough to accommodate the accordion position achieved with the left strap alone. Many accordions have straps too long to be adjusted in this manner. In that case, you might be able to punch more holes in either or both ends of the strap segments to allow them to be shortened by adjusting the buckles. But if this still will not allow the straps to be adjusted tightly enough, you will have no choice but to shorten them. In this case I generally switch the tails so the shorter tail goes with the right strap, so I only have to shorten one of them. In other words, the short tail becomes the long tail and the long tail gets shortened to become the new short tail, usually 4 to 6 inches shorter than the other. Begin by drilling out or prying apart the rivets that hold the large buckle in place. Note the location and size of the slot for the tongue of the buckle and the location and spacing of the rivet holes, and duplicate that pattern farther down the strap at a location that will produce a tail of the desired length. If you wish, you can cut off the excess strap length and use it as a template to make the new holes. Use new two-part rivets to install the buckle in the new location, in the same manner as it was originally installed. If you plan the tail lengths to fit when each tail's buckle tongue is in the middle hole of its upper strap, you will have ample room to make minor adjustments in either direction later.**","title":"Proper shoulder strap lengths"},{"location":"accordion-repair1/#does-your-accordion-need-to-be-re-waxed","text":"The hundreds of aluminum reed plates in your accordion are held to the wooden reed blocks by a mixture of beeswax, resin, and a small amount of linseed oil. Over time this mixture dries, hardens, and becomes brittle. Eventually, it will crack around the reed plates, allowing them to vibrate themselves loose. When your reeds start falling out, it is definitely time to re-wax. However, you might decide to re-wax before reeds start falling out. For instance, if your accordion needs tuning, the reeds should be thoroughly cleaned before tuning begins. This is because the dirt on them is probably what causes them to be out of tune. If you tune a dirty reed, then clean it later, it will need to be tuned again. You can short-cut by using a tiny brass wire brush to clean the outside of each reed tongue, but it is practically impossible to clean the side facing into the reed block. The only way to thoroughly clean them is to take them out of the reed blocks first. This naturally requires waxing them back in after they are cleaned. If very many reeds need tuning, you might as well re-wax the whole thing. There are other reasons to re-wax. The quality of the sound your accordion produces is partially dependent on the condition of the wax. This is because the reed itself produces only a feeble sound until it is anchored to a reed plate and until that reed plate is anchored into a reed block, which in turn is mounted to an accordion. The vibrations of the reed tongue are transmitted through the rivet to the reed plate, then through the wax to the reed block, then through the wooden reed block and on into the accordion cabinet. That's why you can feel the accordion vibrating against your chest as you play it. The accordion cabinet is a bit like the sound board in a piano, or the body of an acoustic guitar. The quality of the sound we hear depends on the efficiency with which those vibrations are transmitted through the various materials, including the wax, as well as on the quality and construction of the reeds and cabinet. Old brittle wax transmits sound differently. Fresh wax could make your accordion sound more like it did when it was new. However, re-waxing is very time consuming and expensive. If you pay to have it done, the cost could exceed the market value of your accordion. In this case you might decide to forego the new wax and just spot tune the reeds needing it most. You might also decide to wax it yourself, in which case you might be interested in the article on waxing reeds to be posted soon on Accordion Repair 2 of this website.","title":"Does your accordion need to be re-waxed?"},{"location":"accordion-repair1/#when-is-it-time-for-a-new-bellows","text":"If an accordion uses very little air, we often describe it as having a good, tight bellows. If it uses lots of air, we sometimes say it has a leaky bellows. But often the leaks are actually elsewhere, in which case replacing the bellows will not solve the problem. How can we know if our bellows should be replaced? Some people replace their bellows just to get a different color. But a new bellows installed can cost $350 to $450. At these costs, you probably prefer not to replace your bellows unless it is truly necessary. The first step is to determine exactly what is leaking. A good article on how to analyze and locate your air leaks is posted elsewhere on this page. Following the procedures outlined there should help you find and fix your leaks, and may save you the expense of a new bellows. If you find the bellows leaking, you may want to replace it, as bellows repair is time consuming and costly, and often leaves the bellows looking a bit rough. However, it still may be economical to repair your old bellows if you do it yourself. If you have eliminated all other possible sources, and if you know your leak is an external leak as defined in the \"finding leaks\" article, you may conclude that your bellows probably has lots of small leaks, each too small to detect, that add up to a lot of lost air. In that case, replacing your bellows will probably breathe new life into your accordion and be well worth the cost. You might also decide to replace your bellows if it has more than two or three loose metal corners. A few corners can be replaced fairly economically (especially if you don't mind leaving the bellows tape in a bit of a mess right at the corners), but replacing them all costs about as much as a new bellows, especially if the bellows is re-taped at the same time. If just a few corners have come loose because the glue has failed, it may make sense to repair it. But if the corners are loose because the metal has cracked, then many other corners are also likely to be cracked and will work loose shortly, in which case you will be better off with a new bellows. You might also consider a new bellows if most of your bellows tape needs replacing, as the labor cost of re-taping an entire bellows could exceed half the cost of a new bellows. The advantages of having a new bellows might outweigh the savings realized from replacing just the tape. These advantages include a long trouble-free service life, a newer appearance, improved air tightness, improved stability, and the opportunity to pick a new color. Improved stability is a factor worth mentioning. Sometimes, even when they don't leak, old bellows just get so loose and flexible that they tend to bulge out of alignment under compression, requiring you to follow them around a bit in order to push them closed. If your bellows starts acting more like a Slinky than a bellows, you might be happier with a new one. You will find two bellows-related articles on the \"Accordion Repair 2\" page of this website - \"Replacing Bellows Tape\", and \"Installing a New Bellows\". In the future you will also find an article on general bellows repairs.","title":"When is it time for a new bellows?"},{"location":"accordion-repair1/#is-it-time-to-revalve-the-treble-side","text":"If you find leaks at the treble valves, you might be able to adjust the pallets to stop the leak. Check first to see that the offending pallets are centered over their ports and that all four corners as well as the centers of each side of each pallet are in firm contact with the foundation plate, and adjust them as necessary for a good seal by bending the key rods. To check for firm contact, cut a narrow strip of paper to use as a feeler gauge under the valve to be sure you have equal drag on all four corners and along each side. See the discussion on leveling the keyboard in the article titled \u201cSetting Up a Treble Keyboard for Shallow Action\u201d for some useful tips on how to bend the key rods without damaging the keys or pallets, and for instructions on how to make the tools you need. Also make sure no debris is lodged under the pallet that might prevent a good seal. If you find all four corners snug, but poor contact along the middle of one or both sides, then you probably have a warped pallet, in which case you will have to remove the pallet, strip off the valve facing, sand the pallet flat, and install new valve facing. If the pallet seems to have firm contact all around, yet still leaks, then remove the key, fluff up the nap of the leather valve facing with a tooth brush, and reinstall it (see the discussion on how to disassemble various kinds of keyboards in the article titled \u201cSetting Up a Treble Keyboard for Shallow Action\u201d). If the leak persists after all this, it is probably because the surface of the valve is pillowed due to compression of the felt liner. It is normal for the nap of the leather to be flattened around the port, leaving a visual image of the ports in the leather facing, but if you can also feel a raised waffle pattern left by the ports, then it may be time to re-valve.** This pillowy waffle pattern is caused by compression of the felt under the leather valve facing due to age and normal wear. Whenever you see noticeable pillowing, you will be better off to re-valve, because the new valves will seal better and will also operate more quietly. If such a valve is off center and you try to center it, the waffle pattern will no longer fit exactly into the ports, and the valve will still leak. The only solution in this case is to replace the valve facing with new leather/felt laminate. If one valve is pillowed, all the others are probably also pillowed, in which case it is time to re-valve the treble side of the accordion. The bass valves normally have thinner felt pads which are much less prone to pillowing. You might decide to re-valve even if no valves are leaking. If any of your treble keys are higher than the ends of the keyboard cabinet, this is usually evidence of valve felt compression. Place a long straightedge lengthwise down the keyboard, extending past the keys at both ends of the keyboard. When the accordion left the factory, all the keys were probably level with the ends of the keyboard. The extent to which you can depress keys with this straightedge is the extent to which compression of your treble valve facings has allowed the keys to rise. Compressed felt is less effective as a cushion, resulting in more noise when the valve slams shut under the pressure of its return spring. The compressed felt also allows the key to return to a higher position, thus lengthening the key stroke and giving the spring more time to accelerate the valve, giving it more momentum to dissipate upon closing. Most of this momentum is dissipated as noise. Leveling the keyboard can eliminate this extra travel and the resulting extra momentum, but it does nothing to make the felt a more effective cushion. If you have a clunky noisy keyboard, re-valving is the best way to improve it. See the article titled \"Renewing Treble Valves\" for tips on how to do it, where to get the felt and leather laminate, and other options for improving and quieting your keyboard action.","title":"Is it time to revalve the treble side?"},{"location":"accordion-repair1/#making-treble-keyboard-bending-tools","text":"You sometimes need to raise or lower treble keys, either to correct one that has been bent upward by catching on a case or strap, or to compensate for different rates of deterioration and compression of the felt valve padding, or to compensate for a slightly different thickness of valve facing material used to re-valve, or to set up the keyboard for shallower action. Raising or lowering treble keys is accomplished by bending the key rods. But let's start with how not to bend key rods, as some people are tempted to try shortcuts, which seldom work out as desired. For instance, do not hold the key down while you press down on the treble pallet, and do not simply pull up on a key to raise it. Either of these actions will compress the felt valve padding, perhaps producing the desired result temporarily, but only until the felt lofts again to near its original thickness over the next few hours. Using this \"shortcut\" could also loosen the treble pallet's connection to the key rod, which is often just a bed of wax. If your \"shortcut\" over-stresses the key's hinge point on wooden keyboards, you may crack the key or the wooden boss on the keyboard cabinet that holds the spindle. On older accordions with the key rod driven into the wooden key like a nail, you also risk loosening the key rod's connection to the key, necessitating a time- consuming repair. The correct way to bend key rods is with two bending tools, one gripping the rod on each side of the point where you want to make the bend. For raising or lowering the key, place the bend as close as possible to the key. If this puts the pallet out of parallel with the foundation plate, causing the valve to leak, then make the compensating bend as close as possible to the pallet. All this is explained in more detail in the article on setting up a treble keyboard. The main thrust of this article is to describe the bending tools and how to make them. The simplest tool is a steel rod with a slot cut in one side of it just the right depth and width to grip the key rod. The problem is that key rods come in many sizes, creating the need for many tools unless you make a set of adjustable tools. We'll get to a couple of designs for adjustable tools shortly, but first let's cover the simple ones. If you are only working on one accordion, then a few simple tools may be all you need. Here is a photo of some of the non-adjustable bending tools I have made from steel rods and bolts. The narrower tools are essential for working on short key rods. The first and second tools from the right, with large grip handles and with slots in the end, are for bending the key rod side to side in order to center the pallet over its ports. The fourth and fifth from the right are for twisting the flatbar style of key rod in order to rock its pallet into parallel with the foundation plate. Note that in each case pairs of tools are used together. The third tool from the right has small pegs through it to engage the key rod, and is useful (in conjunction with one of the other tools) for putting bends very close to the pallet. Here is a close up photo of it. Adjusting valves down inside a tone chamber requires special tools that reach down into the chamber. The seventh and eighth tools from the right in the top photo have worked well on some tone chamber accordions, but I expect to have to make different tools with different slot widths to fit other accordions which have different key rod widths.** My tool design is still evolving, and I expect it will continue to improve. If you come up with any better tool design ideas, I hope you will share them with me. When designing your bending tools, keep four considerations in mind. The first is that the tool must be narrow enough to fit down between adjacent key rods. This dimension varies with different accordions, but bulky tools just won't fit. The second is that wider tools with longer slots to grip the key rod do less damage to the soft aluminum key rods (very narrow tools cause unsightly gouges in the aluminum). The third consideration is that for the short key rods on the black keys, wider tools are not practical, since they do not allow you to put one bend close to the key and another bend close to the pallet. Tools wide enough to preclude any damage to the key rod are also wide enough to occupy the entire length of a short key rod when used in pairs, eliminating any choice on where to place the bend. For your black keys, you will therefore need narrow tools and you will have to live with the divots they leave in the key rods. The fourth consideration is that when raising a key, you will have to move the tools toward each other, and their handles may need to bypass each other in order to make the desired bend, so slender handles work best. You can help minimize key rod damage by making your narrower tools from square rod, rather than round. For any given tool width, this maximizes the contact surface between the tool and the key rod, thus spreading the load. You can also minimize the damage by making the slots just barely wide enough to receive the key rod. A tight fit helps maximize the contact surface between the tool and the key rod, spreading the load over a wider area, thus minimizing the damage. Making your bending tools about six inches long will give you sufficient leverage to bend the key rods. Minimizing the amount of rod extending beyond the lower edge of the slot will help make the tool fit closer to the pallet, making it possible to get your two bend points farther apart, which is particularly important on the black keys and any white keys with short key rods. Here is a photo of some adjustable bending tools I have recently made. The one on the right has a slot in the lower jaw to straddle the key rod extending down into a tone chamber. In the next photo the three on the right above have been disassembled so you can see how they are made. The set screw threads into one half of the tool and rides in a slot in the other half of the tool. The one in the middle has an adjustable slot on each end. The two halves of that tool were made to different lengths to provide different adjustment ranges at each end of the tool. The three extra holes in the tool on the right are unnecessary. They were already in the angle before I converted it to this use. The adjustment, of course, is to allow for gripping a wide variety of key rods of varying thicknesses. I made the tool on the left from some recycled cold formed slotted channel (originally used to mount adjustable shelf brackets to a wall), and from some 1/4\" steel plate I cut from a scrap of 4-inch wide 1/4-inch flat bar. To eliminate the need for a bulky nut, I tapped #10-32 threads in the 1/4-inch plate to receive the pan head set screw. When slightly loosened, the set screw can slide in a 3/4-inch long slot cut into the web of the channel. This gives me an adjustment range of 9/16- inch (3/4-inch minus 3/16-inch for the diameter of the #10 machine screw). I am not a professional tool designer. Although these tools serve their purposes, I am sure more elegant designs are possible, and I encourage you to experiment. If you care to share your improved design, I would love to know about it. - GB","title":"Making treble keyboard bending tools"},{"location":"accordion-repair1/#freeing-sticking-keys","text":"Treble keys sometimes stick open due to dirt or corrosion on the key or the spindle (axle rod), due to warping of wooden keys, or due to bending of aluminum keys. Repairing a key that sticks open requires removing the key, after first removing the grill and possibly the treble switch assembly. On accordions without individually removable keys, pull the spindle out far enough to release the sticking key. Look for the ends of the spindles (or spindle) under a small metal cover on the bottom of the keyboard. If you remove the spindle or spindles without first securing the keys in place, the key springs will fling the keys off the keyboard one at a time as the spindle is withdrawn, so plan to catch them. If they are not already numbered, number each key as it comes off to facilitate getting them all back in their proper places. The usual numbering system is 1 through 41 starting at the bottom of the keyboard if all keys are on one spindle. If there are two spindles, the black and white keys are numbered separately. If you prefer not to remove all the keys above the problem key, and if there are two spindles, you can tape the keys together so that one spindle will hold all keys in place, as described in the following paragraph. If there is only one spindle, you can avoid removing all the keys by clamping them in place in accordance with the paragraph after that. If white and black keys have separate spindles, you can usually avoid removing other keys by taping all the keys (except the keys to be removed) to each other before pulling out the appropriate spindle. (Use 3M Scotch Brand #218 plastic masking tape, as other tapes leave a sticky residue). Place one row of tape near the ends of the white keys and two rows over the black keys, taping to the tops of the white keys and to the sides and tops of the black keys. If you pull out just one spindle, the other spindle and the tape will hold all the taped keys in place. If there is only one spindle for all the keys, you can clamp in place the keys you do not wish to remove, using large spring clamps with extended jaws to hold rods and shims against the keys. A single clamp can hold a wood ruler or similar shaped plastic or aluminum rod across the ends of the white keys, pressing them all down under the clamp's spring pressure. Two other long-jawed spring clamps (bolt 6-inch wood, plastic, or metal extensions to the jaws) can be used to press another similar rod down onto the white and black keys right where the black keys emerge to the level of the tops of the white keys, i.e., at the key hinge point. Finally, a third rod is used as a shim between the extended clamp jaws and the tops of the black keys to help hold the black keys in place. Just make sure none of the rods or shims extends out over the keys you wish to remove. Grip the end of the spindle with small vice-grip pliers, and twist while pulling. Pull the spindle out just far enough to release the sticking key. Lift the key out, carefully noting the placement of the key spring. The free end of the spring must point toward the outer end of the key (not toward the valve), and usually rides in a tiny groove in the wood. Note that this technique does not work on a few models in which both spindles pass through holes in each key. In this case both spindles must be at least partially withdrawn in order to remove any key from either spindle. While you have the spindle partially out, take a close look at it. If it appears dirty or corroded, remove it entirely and clean it with steel wool before reinstalling it. Inspect the key and the keyboard slot for any dirt or lint that could cause the binding, and for shiny spots that indicate where the key is rubbing. For all-wood keys, sand away the shiny spot, finishing with 600 grit sandpaper. For wooden keys with aluminum core, and for all-aluminum keys, very slightly bend the short aluminum tab on the bottom away from the side where it was rubbing to eliminate interference with the slot in the aluminum keyboard. If this tab appears worn or scratched, you should also smooth it out with fine sandpaper and finish it with steel wool. Another option is to shift the key to one side by slightly bending the key hinge. Keep in mind that a very tiny bend at the hinge point results in a relatively large sideways shift out at the end of the key. Reinstall the key and its spring and reinstall the spindle, taking care not to bend it. To avoid bending it, remove a drill chuck from a drill motor (or buy a new drill chuck) and slide it onto the rod, tightening it about four inches from the bottom of the keyboard. Use the chuck to twist and push the rod in, then loosen the chuck, slide it back, tighten it, and push again. If the spindle is brass, avoid marring its finish. You may have to press the keys slightly down into proper alignment to allow the spindle to pass through. The end of the spindle is tapered, so you may be able to see the keys move slightly as the point enters the bore and forces the keys to center themselves on the spindle. If your accordion has a tone chamber, you may find that some of the black key rods intertwine with some of the white key rods in a way that makes it impossible to take out just the black keys or just the white keys. Similarly, you may find that both spindles pass through separate holes in each key. In either of these cases you will have to pull out both spindles and when you put it back together you will have to install black and white keys and both spindles together, and the drill chuck idea will not work because the spindles are too close together. To solve this problem you can make aluminum, plastic, or hard rubber jaws for your small vise grip pliers that allow you to grip each spindle from the side an inch or so away from where it enters the cabinet without marring the smooth finish on the spindle. Here is one I made by hammering some 1/8\" aluminum flat bar around the jaws of an old pair of vice grip pliers. I squeezed those jaws around a file spinning in my drill press to form a rounded groove across each jaw to better grip the spindle. Here is a keyboard going back together using those pliers. If there is no cover on the bottom of the keyboard and no access to the bottom ends of your spindles, then the keys are individually removable. Individually removable keys have slots that engage a spindle that can only be removed after all the keys are out. There are five basic types. The most common type uses a short, stiff retainer spring to hold the spindle in the horizontal leg of an L-shaped slot in the bottom of the key, or more accurately, an L-shaped slot in the brass hinge assembly riveted to the bottom of the key. You cannot see this spring or the slot until you get the key out. You remove these keys by pressing down hard and toward the valve end of the rod in order to get the spindle out of the horizontal leg of the L-shaped slot (by overcoming the force of the retainer spring) and into the vertical leg, then pulling up on the key to lift it off the spindle. Press on the key right where it rotates on the spindle, pushing down and horizontally, then lift vertically by gripping the key rod as close as possible to the key. In this explanation, horizontal means parallel to the key top. Once you have your sticking key out, inspect and repair it as above. To reinstall the key, place it back in its slot with the stiff spring against the keyboard side of the spindle and press the key in the direction of the valve to compress the stiff spring in order to allow the spindle to enter the vertical leg of the slot. As you press the key down, the stiff spring will force the spindle into the horizontal leg of the slot to hold the key in place. A second type of removable key is similar, except they have only a vertical slot (no horizontal leg) and a short coil spring to hold the key in place that must be removed first. With the grille off, you can peak in under the backs of the keys and see these little springs. In these cases, there is often a little tool fastened to the underside of the grille or to the foundation plate under the grille. If not, you can make one from a small screwdriver or any slender steel or aluminum rod. Here are a couple of photos of one I made. The upper end of the coil spring stays connected to the key; you remove the bottom end of the spring from the aluminum tang by pressing the loop on the end of the coil spring downward and off the free end of the tang. You can remove them with practically anything, but you will need the special tool to put them back on. There is a third type of removable key that has a simple aluminum fork on the bottom of the key that straddles the axle of a brass bushing that rotates on the spindle. This type always has the little coil springs described above. After removing the spring, you just pull straight up on the key, using a good grip on the key rod. Some of these are really stubborn and you have to pull really hard with pliers. It is not unusual to have to pull so hard that when it finally suddenly releases, you are unable to stop before the pallet hits something and is knocked off the key rod, so you should have some reed wax handy to wax it back on. See the article on waxing with a modified soldering iron for more details. If you don't get it waxed back on in exactly the same position, and if the leather seal has \"pillowed\" into the ports, it will leak due to the \"pillow\" no longer aligning properly with the port, in which case the best solution will be to replace the felt/leather laminate valve facing on that pallet. See the article on \"re-valving the treble side\". If you have these forked keys and brass bushings, and if you conclude that your problem is high friction between the brass bushing and the spindle or between the brash bushing and its slot in the aluminum chassis, then you will have to take all the keys out and remove the aluminum keyboard chassis from the accordion in order to get the spindle out to clean it. In this case, all the brass bushings will fall out as you remove the spindle, so figure a way to catch them. You can clean them in a little jar of WD-40, agitating it well, then blow them dry with compressed air. Test each of them on the spindle to make sure they all turn freely. Doing this may help clean additional corrosion and dirt out of the interior bore in the bushing. As you put them back in their slots in the aluminum chassis one at a time, feeding in the spindle as you go, make sure each one turns absolutely freely on the spindle and in its slot in the aluminum chassis before installing the next one. The bushings vary up to .004 inch in width, and if you happen to get one of the wider ones in one of the narrower slots in the chassis, it may rub on the chassis. In this case, either find a narrower bushing or file the slot a little wider, but not too wide, or the key may wander too much and interfere with a neighboring key. Every bushing must turn absolutely freely in its slot and on the spindle in order for the keyboard to work smoothly. If some of the key forks are too tight to fit over the brass bushing with moderate pressure, check the sides of them for burrs or spalling and sand these off smooth. If you conclude that the fork is too narrow, you can file it a bit wider, but don't file too much, or the key will be sloppy. You want a snug fit. Don't use any oil, as it will attract lint and dust, which will eventually gum it up and cause keys to stick. This type of keyboard takes longer to clean and adjust, but in the end you will be rewarded, because once it is cleaned and properly adjusted, this design offers the smoothest keyboard action of all. The fourth type of individually removable key is held in place by a sliding clip on each key that slides in under the spindle. Use a flat blade screwdriver to pry the clip away from the spindle (that is, toward the valve end of the key), and lift the key straight up. To replace it, press the key down over the spindle and slide the clip back in. The fifth type has a slotted head twist-fastener right above the spindle on each key. Use a flat blade screwdriver to turn the slotted head of the fastener 90 degrees left to release the key, then pull the key straight up. To put it back, press the key into position over the spindle and turn the fastener 90 degrees to the right. In all cases, test the key for smooth action before returning the accordion to service.","title":"Freeing sticking keys"},{"location":"accordion-repair1/#trouble-shooting-silent-reeds","text":"Silent reeds might be missing, loose, misaligned, or broken, but usually they are just stuck because of foreign matter lodged between the reed tongue and the vent (slot in the reed plate). The hardest part is to positively identify which reed tongue is silent. You can always use your tuning bellows to test each reed in each reed block, in each airflow direction, out on the workbench. But there is a quicker way. First determine which switch controls the problem reed, and in which bellows direction the problem occurs. Then open the accordion and take out the reed blocks to determine which slides are opened by that switch. This tells you which row on the reed block contains your problem reed. Now press the problem key to see which valve opens, and hence, which reed plate in that row contains the silent reed (for example, the fifth valve controls the fifth reed plate in the reed block). If the reed was silent only when the bellows was expanding (air rushing in), then the problem is with the reed tongue on the inside of the reed block, behind the visible leather. If it was silent only when the bellows was compressing (air rushing out), then the problem is with the reed tongue facing you, on the outside of the reed block. If it is the outer tongue, you might cure it by simply plucking it lightly with a single edge razor blade slipped carefully under the tip (to avoid scratching either the reed or the reed plate). Pluck it just enough to get it vibrating. If you can hear the tone of the reed at all, you have probably already cleared it. But if it sounds dull, you may need to take further measures to dislodge foreign matter from between the reed tongue and the vent. Try passing a .0015\u201d metal feeler gauge between the sides of the reed tongue and the vent (slot in the reed plate), but don\u2019t push it in very far, or you will dislodge the leather glued to the opposite side of the reed plate. Then pluck the reed tongue again to see if it seems to be vibrating freely. You can also test it on your tuning bellows if you have one. However, you should avoid blowing the reed like a harmonica, as this could get moisture on the reed, causing it to rust. If the problem was with the inner tongue, try the feeler gauge approach. You will not be able to pluck the reed to check your progress, but you can test it on your tuning bellows, if you have one. If passing the feeler gauge around the sides does not clear it, check the tip. The feeler gauge is too wide to use to clean the narrow end of the vent, but you can use it to clean off the tip of the reed tongue and also to lift the reed tip out of the way (not too far, as you do not want to bend it permanently) while you clean the end of the vent with a tiny brass wire brush, or a straight pin, or even a toothpick. If cleaning fails to solve the problem, then check for misalignment of the reed tongue that causes interference between the reed tongue and the vent. You will probably have to pry the reed plate out of the wax to do this, then wax it back into the reed block after you have repaired it, so if you are not prepared to wax it back in, you should take it to a repairman. If you proceed on your own, hold the reed plate up to a bright light to verify that you have the tongue centered. If the tongue is out of center, pry it back into position. If it moves at all easily, you may have to reset the rivet with a light hammer blow (on an anvil, naturally) after you have the tongue centered.","title":"Trouble-shooting silent reeds"},{"location":"accordion-repair1/#voicing-reeds","text":"You can often significantly improve the performance of your accordion by voicing the reeds. Voicing is setting the tip clearance of the reed tongue above the plane of the reed plate. If the tip is set too high, too much air will escape under it, delaying the onset of vibration, requiring more air to get it started. If it is set too low, it will choke under high bellows pressure. That means it will refuse to vibrate, perhaps because it closes off the reed vent too soon, before it has achieved enough velocity and momentum to travel far enough to cause a rebound powerful enough to start the oscillation. Changing the tip clearance obviously requires permanently bending the reed tongue. You can't voice the reed just by lightly flexing it or by gently stroking it, or it will simply spring back to its original position. If you want it to take a permanent set at a new level relative to the reed plate, then you have to bend it far enough to exceed its elastic limit (which by definition is the bending limit beyond which it will not spring completely back to its original position). However, you also want the reed tongue to remain straight and parallel with the top of the reed plate or angled slightly up from it, but not having any curvature, so you have to make sure the permanent bend occurs very close to the rivet. You can't just grab it by the tip and push or pull, or the bend might occur somewhere midway along the reed tongue, or perhaps even close to the tip, especially on the smallest reeds. To get it to yield close to the rivet, you should apply the force at least half way down the tongue. This is where the reed tongue is wider and possibly thicker, and where you have the least leverage, so you have to push or pull pretty hard, and there is the rub. If you push or pull too hard, the permanent deflection may be greater than you want, in which case you will have to bend it back the other way by exceeding the elastic limit again. There is a limit to the number of times you can do this, because each time you exceed the elastic limit, you raise the elastic limit of the steel in the area of the bend so that even more force will be required to exceed the elastic limit at that location next time (this is sometimes called \"work hardening\" - you can see it in action by repeatedly bending and straightening any steel wire, such as a paper clip). As the elastic limit increases due to bending beyond the previous elastic limit, by definition the area of the bend becomes more resistant to permanent bending, so the next permanent bend tends to occur somewhere else, where the elastic limit has not yet been raised, and where it will therefore yield under less applied force. In practice, this means that if you want your permanent bend right next to the rivet, you have to get it right the first time, or at least very soon after that. If you exceed the elastic limit very many times, your bend might end up farther away from the rivet. If you somehow force it to bend at the exact same spot each time, then its elastic limit at that point will eventually be raised to the ultimatum yield point, at which point the reed tongue will break, rather than bend. This is not to say that there is a limit to how many times the reed can flex before it breaks. As far as I know, there is no such limit, as long as it does not flex beyond its elastic limit. Reeds flex millions (or maybe billions) of times during the life of an accordion, so you can try as many times as you like to bend the reed short of reaching its elastic limit, and you will not hurt it, but of course, you won't change its voicing, either. This all suggests that the best way to voice a reed is with several attempts, starting gently, and gradually increasing the applied force with each trial, checking each time to see if the latest attempt has succeeded in making a permanent bend. There is no penalty for applying too little force, other than a slight delay in reaching your objective. With experience, you will learn how much force to apply the first time, so you can avoid wasting a lot of time working up to the elastic limit, yet still be reasonably certain that you will not exceed the limit on your first try. I say \"reasonably certain\" because reeds vary in hardness and in their elastic limits, and even after you have experience, you will undoubtedly encounter some reeds that are much softer and with lower elastic limits than most, and which take a permanent bend much sooner (and farther) than you expect. When this happens, you should reduce the force you use in subsequent trials, and try to work gradually up to the lower elastic limit of that particular reed. The tools used in voicing are very simple. For lifting an exterior reed tongue to increase its tip clearance, you just need a thin piece of metal to get behind the reed tongue and evenly support the upper half to two thirds of it while you bend it upward. I use a dull single edge razor blade on small reeds, and a .010\" metal feeler gauge on larger reeds. For lowering an exterior reed tongue to decrease its tip clearance, you apply force in the lower half of the tongue, forcing it down into the vent. I use a flat blade screwdriver with a tip narrow enough to pass through the vent without scratching the sides. To avoid letting the screwdriver slip toward the tip of the reed tongue, I hold the screwdriver shank nearly parallel to the reed and rock the tip into the tongue, rather than poking it straight in. If you are voicing an interior reed tongue on a reed mounted in its reed block, the process is similar. To increase the tip clearance, rock the screwdriver tip down into the vent and against the tongue at a point about a third of the way up from the rivet. If you try to leave the leather on while you do this, you are likely to damage it, so I think you are better off to remove the leather to better see what you are doing, as well as to allow you to work from the fixed end of the reed tongue. Glue the leather (or a new one) back on when you are finished. On larger reeds, you often must push the tongue so far in that it hits the back of its reed chamber and visibly bends to conform to the limits of the chamber. There is some risk that in addition to bending near the rivet, the tongue will bend in the opposite direction about where it contacts the back of the reed chamber. Such a bend puts undesirable curvature in the reed tongue, making it impossible to voice it correctly until it is straightened. If you are exerting force at about the 1/3 point, the reed tongue will nearly always reach its elastic limit near the rivet before it does in the area of the reverse bend, but not always. The major exception is with some handmade reed sets in which a few of the largest treble bassoon reeds have a a very thin cross section near the rivet and a step up in thickness about half way out from the rivet. On those reeds, the tongue will reach its elastic limit and take a permanent bend near the rivet, but it is also likely to take a permanent bend in the reverse direction right at the step up in thickness, somewhere near the middle of the reed tongue. If this occurs, you will have to remove the reed from the reed block to straighten that tongue before you can voice it. To save wear and tear on the reed, it is best to remove this type of reed from the reed block before you try to increase the tip clearance of the inner tongue. Increase the clearance to match the clearance of its properly voiced twin on the opposite side of the reed plate, then wax it back in. This Binci handmade reed has been flipped over to show what happened to the interior reed tongue when I tried to increase its tip clearance without removing the reed from the reed block. The reed would no longer sound until after I removed it, straightened it, properly voiced it, and waxed it back in. To decrease the tip clearance of an interior reed tongue, you must push the tongue up into the vent. This is the trickiest scenario, because you must work through the hole in the bottom of the reed block, where it is hard to see exactly where your tool is contacting the reed tongue. In addition, the upward force you apply on the reed tongue might jack the reed plate right out of its wax mounting if you don't adequately support it. It is also harder to see and properly judge the amount of tip clearance and any impact you are having on it. Start by laying your pry bar (narrow screwdriver) on the exterior face of the reed plate to measure how much of the shank you will want inside the reed block in order for the tip to contact the interior reed tongue at the desired point, i.e., 1/3 of the way from the rivet to the tip. Make some kind of mark on the shank, then insert it up to the mark and align it with the interior reed tongue. As you rock the handle downward, using the interior edge of the reed chamber as a fulcrum, the screwdriver tip and the reed tongue will rise into the vent. Be sure to have a firm grip on the reed plate, squeezing it onto the reed block to prevent the upward force of the tool from pushing the reed plate out of the wax. As always, be gentle at first. Rock the tongue a little ways up into the vent, then check the tip clearance to see if you have decreased it. You want to approach the elastic limit of the reed tongue gradually, so as not to significantly overshoot. The goal is to have the minimum possible tip clearance that will not cause the reed to choke. Unfortunately, there is no way to know where the minimum is until you exceed it. Different reeds have different response times, even when properly voiced, so if you are really after the absolute best performance your reeds can deliver, you can\u2019t simply stop when the response seems pretty good. Well, you can, and in fact that is almost certainly good enough, but who among us can stop there, if there may be some possibility of getting even better response? To get the absolute best possible response, you need to find the point where the reed begins to choke, then widen the clearance the minimum amount to get it to not choke. If you are opening up the clearance on a reed that has already been choking, this just comes naturally. But if you are narrowing the clearance on a reed that has been responding too slowly, then you will have to keep narrowing it bit by bit until it begins to choke under sudden high pressure on your test bellows. Of course, that means you have gone too far, and will have to exceed the elastic limit one more time to put it right, but that\u2019s okay, as long as you don\u2019t do it too many times. Voicing requires patience. After several failed attempts to change the tip clearance, frustration can cause you to suddenly get too rough with it and bend it too far. It is important to very gradually increase the force applied with each attempt, i.e., bend it just very slightly farther each time, until you just barely exceed the elastic limit. You will know you have barely exceeded the elastic limit when the reed tip returns to a slightly different clearance than before. The optimum clearance is often about one reed tip thickness above the reed plate. However, this varies slightly from reed to reed, so simply measuring the clearance will not ensure optimum performance. You have to check it on your test bellows. Decrease the clearance a tiny bit at a time until you can just barely make the reed choke with a sudden onset of high bellows pressure on your test bellows, then back it off the minimum amount required to eliminate the choking. You have to be especially careful when voicing the very smallest piccolo reeds, as they are very thin and bend readily (the smallest ones are only about .002\" thick near the free end).The optimum tip clearance under the reed tongue is often too small to see without magnification (sometimes as little as .0015\"), making the required changes likewise too small to see. In this case you will be unable to monitor your progress visually unless you remove the reed from the reed block and view it under moderately high magnification, say 10x to 20x. In the absence of such magnification, if you actually see a change in tip clearance, you have almost certainly gone too far. It is very easy to bend these tiny reeds too far, or to ruin them by putting a visible bend or kink near the tip of the reed tongue. You want the bend to be imperceptibly small, and located very near the fixed end of the reed tongue. It is best to remove these tiny reeds from the reed block, make your bends under magnification so you can see your progress, test the voicing by placing the reed directly over the opening on the top of your test bellows, and wax the reed back into the reed block only after both its tongues have been properly voiced. You should push on these tiny reed tongues only within the bottom half of their length, and gently. Use a wooden toothpick or a tiny screwdriver or similar tool, taking extreme care not to let it slip toward the free end of the reed tongue, or you may inadvertently bend just the tip, which will ruin the reed (unless you are patient enough and fortunate enough to be able to straighten it under magnification, as described on page \"Accordion Repair 3\" near the end of the tuning article). When adjusting the tip downward, a good way to maintain control of your tool and of the pressure you apply is to rest the shank of your tool on the reed plate at the top (narrow) end of the reed vent, and rock the tip of your tool downward against the top of the reed tongue, forcing it down into the vent. This gives you precise control over how much pressure you apply, how far you deflect the reed tongue, and exactly where on the reed tongue you apply the pressure. Similarly, when lifting the tongue, support it along more than half its length, rather than just pulling on the very tip. Slide a dull single edge razor blade or a .002\" metal feeler gauge under the reed tongue to lift it. Be very careful not to bend it too far. If you actually feel it yield, then you almost certainly have gone too far and may have ruined the reed. It is best to begin with very light pressures and minimal deflections, checking each time on the test bellows to see if you have improved the voicing. It is impossible to voice these smallest reeds if they have been arched by excessive pressure during tuning, or if their tips have been bent up or down or twisted during tuning or voicing. You can sometimes hear the hiss of air escaping under these arched or twisted reed tongues before they begin to sound (if they sound at all). The easiest thing to do in these cases is to replace the reeds, but it is sometimes possible to straighten them. Take them out of the reed block and use 10X to 20X magnification to precisely locate the bends that need to be taken out, and to monitor your progress. Only after they are straightened can they be properly voiced. See the tuning section on the Accordion Repair 3 page for some suggestions for making and using bending tools under magnification. After all this bending and straightening, these tiny reeds will almost certainly be out of tune, so you will have to tune them. Hint: Use #220 grit or finer sandpaper and light pressure, rather than a file or scratcher, both of which are far too blunt and crude for these tiny reed tongues. The use of inappropriate tuning tools is probably what ruined these reeds in the first place. To make an appropriate tuning tool, you can wrap and glue narrow strips of fine sandpaper over the ends of short wooden rods, approximately 1/8\" square by three or four inches long. See the tuning section on the Accordion Repair 3 page for more information. Regardless of the size of the reed, voicing the exterior reed tongues is fairly straightforward because you have good access and (except on the smallest reeds) you can easily see your progress as the tip clearance increases or decreases. Seeing and judging the tip clearance of interior reed tongues, however, is more difficult. The apparent tip clearance varies with your viewing angle, so to monitor your progress it is important to view it from the same angle each time. It is also more difficult to bend the reed tongue outward, as you must work through the small opening in the bottom of the reed block. On the smallest reeds you will have to take special care not to press too near the tip of the reed tongue, and this is especially difficult to judge when working in such a confined space. Sometimes the geometry of the reed chamber will not allow you to use a straight tool to bend the reed tongue, in which case you will have to use something curved or bent. I solve this problem by using a couple of very small screwdrivers that I have bent for this purpose. If it seems easier, just take the reed out of the reed block while you voice it, then wax it back in. Good reed response is very desirable in an accordion. Many accordion players pay thousands of dollars extra for top quality accordions with handmade reeds because handmade reeds respond more quickly. Slow responding reeds throw off the timing of the music and cause your accordion to use more air. Fast reed response is especially important when playing very fast pieces and when playing softly, but is noticeable and very pleasing in any kind of playing. Whatever the quality of your reeds, you can optimize their response by ensuring that they are properly voiced.","title":"Voicing reeds"},{"location":"accordion-repair1/#piano-accordion-trouble-shooting-guide","text":"Bass terminology: The button is on the end of a piston which has pegs or tabs that engage levers on bellcranks (also called cams or pipes).

A standard 120/41 LMMH accordion has about 380 leathers in it, and given enough time they will all eventually need replacing. They should lie flat against the reed plate, but with age they begin to curl back. If they are curled back more than 1/16\u201d, they should probably be replaced, and if they are curled more than 1/8\u201d they definitely should be replaced. Nearly all old accordions need at least some of them changed, and many need all of them changed. Changing leathers is not difficult, and you can save money by doing it yourself. Bad leathers curl back like some of these: Good leathers lie flat like these: Marginal leathers hang open just a bit, like some of these: Before you try to change any reed leathers, take the reed blocks out of the accordion. You might get away with taking out just the one you want to work on, but it is safer to take them all out so you don't accidentally catch any leathers and bend them back while trying to sneak a completed reed block back down between two that you left in the accordion. If you have a 4-reed accordion, your reed blocks should look something like this: The outer leathers are very easy to change. You just strip the old one off and glue a new one on. To avoid throwing the reed out of tune, ensure that the new one gets anchored (glued) along the same amount of its length as the old one. The John Reuther book, Accordion Repair Made Easy, recommends using burnt shellac as glue, but burning the alcohol off a bowl of shellac until it becomes thick enough to use as glue seems a bit barbaric when you can buy equally good glue right off the shelf. Thanks to a tip from Kimric Smythe of Smythe Accordions in Oakland California, I have successfully used Indian Head Gasket Shellac or Versachem Lion Gasket Shellac, available in little brown 2 ounce plastic bottles at auto parts stores for about $3. One bottle is enough to glue several thousand leathers. When you first open the bottle, you will find a uselessly large applicator brush fixed to the lid. Scrape the glue off it and back into the bottle, use side-cutter pliers to cut the brush stem as close to the lid as possible, and throw the brush away. You will be using wooden toothpicks to apply the glue to your leathers. I have also successfully used Aleene's Original Tacky Glue, which comes in a convenient squeeze bottle. I squeeze a small bead of glue onto the end of the leather, then spread it with a wooden toothpick. This glue seems to stay soft better than the gasket shellac, and provides a stronger bond, but consequently is harder to remove. I'm sure there are many other glues that will work as well. If you choose to scrape the old glue off the reed plate (recommended), use a hard wood scraper. Cut a piece about 1/4\u201d x 1/4\u201d x about 6 inches long, and use your belt sander to put a beveled \u201cchisel\u201d edge on the end to use as your scraper. For really tough old glue, you can resort to an aluminum scraper, or maybe even a brass scraper, but be careful not to scratch the reed plate. Aluminum and brass scrapers can be made by hammering flat the end of a small diameter aluminum or brass rod or tube and filing it to the desired shape. Steel scrapers are inappropriate, as they will far too readily scratch the aluminum. Be sure to brush and shake out and/or blow away all the little bits of debris that might later lodge between a reed tongue and reed vent and silence a reed. An old tooth brush works well, as long as you are careful not to wedge a bristle between the reed tongue and the vent, which will be hard to get out. Scraping and brushing are worth the time. A little bit of cleanliness now will save you a lot of heartache later. However, don't use canned air, as it will chill the reeds and cause condensation to form. Reed leathers come only in certain lengths, so you will usually have to cut the next larger size down to fit the reed vent. You want the fixed end of the leather to butt up against the rivet and the free end to extend only about 1/32\u201d past the end of the reed vent. I use a single edge razor blade mounted in a window scraper to cut the leathers guillotine style. Cutting them with scissors does not work well, as it is nearly impossible to get a square cut. Curl the leather in your fingers to put a small amount of curvature in it (smooth side out, fuzzy side in), to bias it toward the reed plate. Don\u2019t put much curvature in it though, because if the center of it arches off the reed plate it will operate very noisily. You must make sure it lies perfectly flat on the reed plate. Apply the glue sparingly to the fuzzy side of the leather (along only that part of its length that you wish to anchor), because you do not want any excess glue to run down into the reed vent. Use a normally closed tweezers to grip the leather by the free end. Place the fixed end against the rivet, make sure the leather is centered laterally over the vent, press it into place with a finger, then release the tweezers. If necessary, you will have a few seconds to properly align it before the glue sets up. It will be dry enough to play the accordion after about a minute. Changing interior leathers takes more skill and patience than changing the exterior ones. It\u2019s a bit like building a ship in a bottle, as you are working in a really confined space through a very small opening. A headlamp is absolutely essential for seeing into the reed chamber while you work. Pull the old leather out with tweezers, and don\u2019t even try to clean the old glue off the reed plate, as it will be impossible to get out all the debris you will generate. It is better to leave all that stuff undisturbed and anchored into the new glue. Cut the leather to the proper length using the exterior reed vent and leather as your guide. It is critically important not to make it so long that it will hang up on the end of the reed chamber. Put a small amount of bias (curvature) into the leather, just as you did for the exterior leathers. Apply glue to the fuzzy side of one end of the leather, just as you do for exterior leathers, but this time you will have no choice but to grip the leather by the fixed (glued) end, which means you will inevitably get some glue on your tweezers. This will cause the leather to want to stick to your tweezers and come back out of the reed chamber with the tweezers when you pull the tweezers out. Sometimes you can prevent this by hooking the end of the leather behind the rivet, pulling the tweezers free, and letting the leather fall into place. It also helps to put a thin shim (the same thickness as the leather) between the jaws of the tweezers to prevent the tweezers from gripping the leather too tightly. The next step is to align the leather with the vent and then pat it into place using a small flat blade screwdriver, making sure it lies perfectly flat. It is critically important to ensure that the leather is not so close to the sides or end of the reed chamber that it will catch on the wood while operating. It is equally important to ensure that the leather does not touch the reed tongue right beside it in the reed chamber, or that reed will be silenced. You must also be careful not to get any glue on that reed tongue, as the weight of it will throw the reed out of tune. Finally, verify that the new leather operates freely by pressing the outer reed tongue into its slot far enough to lift the leather, and watching it fall back into place. The larger leathers sometimes have little metal spines (contrapelli) attached to stiffen them. They are generally held in place by leather \u201cdots\u201d of either 6 mm or 8 mm diameter. You can either buy new ones or reuse the old ones. Place the metal spine centered on the leather, put a small drop of fabric glue on the fuzzy side of the leather dot (I use a toothpick embedded in the glue to transport the dot to the reed valve), and while you hold the spine firmly in place with one finger, use another finger to press the dot into place over one end of the spine. Fabric glue dries almost instantly, so work quickly. I get my leathers, dots, and contrapelli from Letizia Bompezzo in Castelfidardo, Italy. I order via email, in English. I don\u2019t know if she has a minimum order size, as I normally order several thousand leathers at a time. In these quantities the average cost of the leathers is usually under $.10 each, depending on the mix of sizes. However, the freight from Italy significantly increases that cost (shipping cost on a recent order was $59.00), so to save on freight charges I sometimes order when I am also ordering a bellows or some other major component from another supplier, and I ask Ms. Bompezzo to deliver the leathers to my other supplier for shipment in the same box, which she has kindly done.

Email targetentertainment.net@gmail.com. Steve is a dealer for FRM Enterprises and can accommodate orders below FRM's minimum amount. Most accordions use real leather (goatskin) reed valves, as described above, but some designs use plastic \"ventilli\". Plastic ventilli are available in so many lengths that you seldom need to cut one to fit. You can buy them from accordion parts suppliers such as FRM Enterprises, or online. Some designs incorporate a hole to fit over the rivet, others are designed like leathers, to butt up against the rivet. I have not tried using alternate materials, but one reader of this site, Donald Thornhill, offers the following alternate sourcing tip. These are his words: \"I have found 1.5 mylar 1/4 inch wide audiotape to be excellent. 2 layers actually. One being shorter by 5/16 inch. I may be a little more cautious when I am at the last 25% of the 7 inch spool of tape as it will maybe have a little more curl from being on the reel. What I could do is maybe reserve that portion for the lower octave reeds vs the higher ones. Also, I put the oxide part inwards adjacent to the plate. I use epoxy for the glue...the kind that is in the two tubes. Best to avoid the cheap dollar store kind. The valves will allow themselves to be easily changed. You will also know it is 1.5 ml as a full 7 inch reel is 1200 feet (Not 1800 feet or 2400 feet etc.) Do not use acetate kind. Only the mylar. I am not sure of the kind marked polyester. A 3/16 inch glue area is enough. Make sure the end at the base is adjacent to the rivet and that the other end need only just cover the end of the reed window. You have to keep in mind that the inside valves are just about no clearance from the wood in many instances.\" Plastic ventilli do not curl over time, and seldom need to be replaced unless damaged by careless handling. Even accordions using plastic ventilli on most of their reeds usually have leathers on the largest reeds, and sometimes have composite reed valves comprised of leather with a layer of mylar over it. These are very similar to the composite leathers Ms. Bompezzo sells as an alternative to using the little metal spines (contrapelli) to stiffen the larger leathers. For more discussion of the relative merits of mylar ventilli versus leather reed valves, see the article titled \"Reed Valves - Plastic or Leather?\"","title":"Changing reed leathers"},{"location":"accordion-repair1/#finding-air-leaks","text":"Most old accordions leak air somewhere, either through screw holes or cracks in the cabinet, or between the cabinet and the foundation plate, or through one of the bellows gaskets, or around one or more of the 41 treble valves and 24 bass valves, or through the switch linkage, or through the bellows themselves. Sometimes missing or broken reeds cause significant air leaks. Loose reed blocks can also waste a lot of air. Bad leathers can also increase air consumption. There are lots of possible sources of leaks, and a few small leaks can add up to a significant loss of air and accordion performance. Air leakage can make an accordion difficult to play. Leaks come in two categories, external and internal. External leaks are those that allow the bellows to fall open or closed without any keys or buttons being pressed. Internal leaks are those that only show up while the accordion is being played. They allow air to find its way to an open note valve without first having to pass through the reed that is being played. It is important to identify whether your leaks are external or internal so you know where to look and what to look for. External leaks are little holes and gaps where air passes into or out of the accordion without first having to pass through the reeds and valves. Fortunately, these are the easiest to find, as the escaping air can usually be heard and felt. The most common places to find external leaks are at the bellows gaskets, around loose or missing screws, shoulder strap brackets, or switch linkages, through damaged or misaligned treble and bass valves, and through loose or missing bellows corners. Bellows gaskets are easy to change, and loose screws can easily be tightened. Small holes in the wood can be quickly sealed with reed wax. Leaking valves can be simple to repair, but in some cases can be time consuming, especially for leaking bass valves because they are so hard to access. A single leaking bellows corner can be easy to fix, but if more than a couple of corners are leaking, you probably need a new bellows. Internal leaks only show themselves while a valve is open, that is, while the accordion is being played. The bellows can seem nice and tight while no keys are depressed, but the accordion consumes too much air when you play it. Sometimes these leaks can be heard as a hissing sound while a note is sounding, but their air streams can never be felt, as they are inside the accordion. The most common causes of internal leaks are bad or missing leathers, bent or broken reed tongues, loose reed plates, and loose or warped reed blocks. Internal leaks are often more time consuming to locate and repair. To find out if your leak is internal or external, measure the amount of time it takes the bellows to close under its own weight from the full open position with all valves closed. Rest your accordion on its feet on a sturdy table. Unsnap the bellows straps, grip one end of the treble keyboard in each hand, press a few keys on each end, and lift the treble section to expand the bellows. Don't mind the discordant sound as air rushes into the bellows through the random combination of open valves. Keep lifting until the bellows is all the way open and the bass section lifts off the table. Shake it a bit to make sure the bellows is fully extended, then release all the keys so all valves are closed (but don\u2019t drop the accordion). Note the time on a clock with a sweep second hand and let the bellows close by itself under the full weight of the treble section. Don't let go, but don't hold any weight, either. Use your hands to keep the bellows going down straight, but not to hold it open or force it closed. If the bellows takes less than 35 seconds to close, it has some external air leaks, as nearly all accordions do. If it takes less than 20 seconds to close, then you probably have an external leak large enough to easily locate and repair. If it takes between 20 and 35 seconds to collapse, the leaks will be much harder to find unless you use a sensitive microphone and amplifier to listen for them, as described in the article after this one titled \"The Superstar Accordion Leak Detector\". To find the source of the leak without such a microphone, expand the bellows exactly as before, but this time as the bellows slowly closes under its own weight, pass your face around the exterior, feeling for drafts of air on your cheeks. Turn the accordion around and repeat the process until you have passed your face around the entire perimeter of both bellows gaskets. The skin on your face is very sensitive to tiny drafts, and most external leaks of any consequence can be found in this manner. To verify that you have found the exact source of the leak, put a small piece of masking tape over the suspected source and repeat the test. If the leak can no longer be felt, then you can be pretty sure it is under the tape. If no leaks are found around the bellows, remove the treble grille and repeat the process to check for leaks around the treble valves. You can often isolate a single leaking valve by pressing it down lightly with your finger. If this stops the leak, you have found the source. You may be able to see that this valve does not rest flat on the foundation plate, or that it is not centered over its ports. If it appears to be centered, then the leak may be due to it being slightly tipped one way or another, or due to it being warped. You can use a narrow strip of paper as a feeler gauge to feel under both sides, both ends, and the center of the valve to be sure that each end, each side, and the center of the valve are all closing tightly against the foundation plate. Another way to find treble valve leaks is to open the accordion, remove the treble reed blocks, make sure all the switch slides are open, and in a dark room pass a bright light around the reed block side of the foundation plate while you look for glowing felt pads on the valve side of the plate. Any glowing felt represents a probable air leak. Pass the bright light around this side: While looking for glowing felt on this side: (You're right, these are two different accordions, and you would put the missing key back in before performing the test, but you get the idea.) Be aware, though, that on some accordions, mostly the very old ones from the 1930s and earlier, removing the reed blocks sometimes allows the foundation plate to flex, which can give false results on this test. That is, the valves that appear to be leaking under the bright light may not actually leak when the reed blocks are re-installed and the foundation plate is once again stiffened by their presence. Alternatively, the valves might pass the light test, but leak when the reed blocks are put back in, due to distortion of the foundation plate. However, on most newer accordions, this test works very well. This same test can be performed on the bass valves, but the bass machine must first be removed, and in the vast majority of accordions, this requires disassembling it piece by piece, a very time consuming project. An easier way to check bass valves for leaks (especially if the leather valve facings are light colored) is to remove the bass reed blocks and look at the valves from the inside. Gently press each valve open with a pencil eraser or other small blunt tool, and look for dust trails around the edges of the leather. The edges of the valves, where the nap of the leather has been flattened by contact with the foundation plate, should be clean. Dirty looking leather along these edges is an indication of a chronic air leak. You may also find wood splinters, wax chips, or other foreign matter lodged under the valve, preventing it from sealing against the foundation plate, in which case you can probably cure the problem by removing the obstruction with a pair of tweezers. This one was an easy fix: Sometimes, many individually imperceptible leaks in the bellows can add up to a significant external air leak. In this case, the only remedy is a new bellows. However, this is fairly unusual, so eliminate all the other possible leak sources before committing to a new bellows. For the ultimate in external leak detection, see the article titled \"The Superstar Accordion Leak Detector\". If your timed bellows collapse test reveals no significant external air leaks, but the accordion uses too much air when you play it, then you probably have an internal leak. To evaluate those, you will need to open the accordion. When you have it open, check first for bad leathers and broken, loose, or missing reeds. There may be some problems that you can't see, that will show up only on a test bellows, but don't worry about that right now, just look for obvious problems. If lots of leathers are curled way back from their reed plates, replacing them may significantly decrease the accordion's air consumption. If one or more reeds are loose or have fallen out, re-waxing them may solve the problem. Can you spot the missing reeds and the bad leathers in this accordion? Also check for loose reed blocks. If they move at all when you try to wiggle them, they are too loose, and simply tightening their mounting latch screw and/or installing a thin shim under the reed block restraint at the opposite end could cure the problem. In the photo below, the two screws in the top of each reed block are for securing the slide latch in locked position. The single screw immediately to the right of each reed block is for adjusting the downward pressure on the reed block. This screw should be snug enough to prevent the reed block from rocking or sliding around, but not so tight that pressure on the reed blocks distorts the foundation plate. If the slide latch end of the reed block seems tight enough, but the other end seems loose, add paper or card stock shims as shown below. Add enough shims for a snug fit, but not enough to cause the slide latch end of the reed block to rise off the foundation plate. A drop of glue will hold your shims in place. If you find no obvious problem, then diagnosing and repairing the internal air leak could take some time. There may be warped reed blocks allowing air to pass under their edges and directly to the open valve ports without first passing through the desired reeds. You can check for this by placing the reed block on a perfectly flat table and using a .003\" metal feeler gauge to check for clearance between the table and the bottom of the reed block. If you find clearance at one corner or in the middle, the rest of the reed block will have to be sanded down to eliminate this clearance. Before sanding, however, you should move the reed block around on the table to make sure that irregularities in the table surface are not responsible for the clearance. There might be reeds deformed by excessive pressure during tuning (you will be able to see a slight arch in the reed tongue), or there might be reeds that need to be properly voiced (you will notice that they respond slowly, and/or that they hiss before beginning to sound their notes). Air might be leaking through cracks in the reed wax or around reed plates that have separated from the wax but have not yet fallen out. Even if the wax looks good, it might not seal to the wood separating two reed chambers, allowing air to leak from one reed chamber to the next. I have even found holes in the wood separations between adjacent reed chambers that allow air to leak from one to another. You can use your test bellows to check for these problems.","title":"Finding air leaks"},{"location":"accordion-repair1/#the-superstar-accordion-leak-detector","text":"One of the most time consuming aspects of accordion repair is locating air leaks. While large external leaks can be found by ear and/or by feeling the air stream on your face, finding them is often a two person job. Moreover, many external leaks including treble valve leaks are often difficult to feel, or even to hear, yet significantly impact performance, and down in the tone chamber they can be especially hard to locate. Bass valve leaks are hard to locate because you can\u2019t get sufficiently close to them without first dismantling the bass machine. Then there is the problem of being certain that you have found and repaired all the other leaks in the accordion so you can confidently tell your customer that the remaining air loss is definitely in the bellows, where we often suspect, but cannot prove, that tiny leaks at each of the bellows corners, while individually undetectable, are adding up to to a big loss of air. All these problems are instantly solved by using a miniature electret condenser microphone and amplifier with headphone. This device makes finding leaks a one person job. More importantly, it makes even the tiniest leak literally roar into the headphones. I use a 4mm diameter unidirectional electret condenser microphone element with a compact pre-amp and amplifier circuit designed for me by Alan Polivka to run on a 9-volt battery. I squeezed it all, including circuit board, battery, microphone jack, volume control, and on/off switch, into a 2 1/8\u201d x 3 1/4\u201d x 1 1/4\u201d (54 mm x 83 mm x 32 mm) plastic box that clips onto my pocket. A cheap stereo headphone completes the assembly. Mounting the tiny and fragile microphone element into one end of a 6-inch (15 cm) length of 3/16\u201d (5 mm) o.d. pvc tubing protects it from damage, yet still allows putting it down into some very tight places. Just use a 4 mm drill bit to enlarge about \u00bc inch (6 mm) of one end of the tube to snugly fit the 4 mm microphone element. A squirt of hot glue from a glue gun into the opposite end of the pvc tube holds the microphone wires firmly in place and eliminates any chance of pulling them off the microphone element during normal use. The elasticity of this pvc wand acoustically isolates the microphone from your hand, thereby minimizing the noise caused by gripping the wand with your fingers or by rubbing it against parts of the accordion, thus eliminating the main annoyance of using a stethoscope, which tends to roar anytime you move it. This little microphone reaches into places a medical stethoscope won\u2019t go, and is far more sensitive to air flow. It fits down between treble valve rods to listen right alongside each treble valve, including those in the tone chamber. It reaches down through the pistons of the bass machine to listen alongside individual bass valves, bass register slide pivots, and other foundation plate penetrations. Unlike lengthening a stethoscope hose or adding slimmer tubular extensions to reach int tight places, lengthening the microphone cord or wand does not decrease its sensitivity. It is great for listening around cabinetry joints and foundation plate edges in behind the treble valve rods and around the bass cabinet, as well as around the bellows gaskets and external screws. It allows you to find smaller leaks than are detectable by any other means, including a stethoscope. Repairing even these seemingly minor leaks can significantly extend bellows collapse time, thus improving accordion performance and gaining you happier customers. The attached photo, circuit diagram, and parts list should allow you to build your own Superstar Accordion Leak Detector for about $60 in parts and supplies, including the headset and battery, plus the cost of shipping components from several sources. Unless you are an experienced electronics technician, I recommend that you purchase more than one microphone element ($2 each), because of the high likelihood of destroying them during construction (I ruined 4 out of 10). For someone new to electronic assembly (like me), the challenges involved in the construction include laying out the circuit board elements to fit on such a small board, laying out the board and all the other components to fit into such a small box, soldering wire leads to the tiny pins on the back of the microphone element (best done under 10x magnification) without overheating it or shorting it, and getting the microphone element and its new leads safely mounted in the pvc tube without ripping the leads off the microphone in the process. Challenging as it is, the convenience of the tiny amplifier and the astonishing effectiveness of this mini microphone at finding accordion leaks make it all worthwhile. If you do much accordion repair, you will soon wonder how you ever survived without this little gem.

It is even more annoying if it is in a place that causes an air leak. Sometimes you can get away with using the next larger diameter screw, but sometimes that is not practical, in which case you must fill the hole and start over. This simple procedure also comes in handy whenever you want to fill an old hole after moving some bracket, strap, or snap to a new location. If the hole is small enough, you can use a round or square wooden toothpick (the flat ones do not work well) as a plug. If the hole is too large for a toothpick, use a small softwood dowel, available at the building supply store for under a dollar. Whatever your chosen plug, make it longer than the depth of the hole you are filling, because you will want to trim it off flush later. If using a toothpick, trim off part of the point as required for a slightly snug fit in the hole, then shave the rest of it down to that same diameter. If using a dowel, either shave it down to fit the hole or ream the hole larger for a slightly snug fit around the dowel. Work from the outside, but check on the inside to be sure the plug or the glue you will use will not interfere with anything on that side. Use a wooden toothpick to coat the inside of the hole and the outside of the plug with Elmer's wood glue. Push the plug into the hole until it bottoms out or, if the hole goes all the way through, until it is flush with the wood on the other side. Let the glue dry for several hours. When the glue has dried, trim the plug flush with the surface with a single edge razor. If you plan to install a new screw in the hole, use a tiny drill bit (no more than 2/3 the diameter of the screw) to drill a pilot hole. If your new screw is smaller than the smallest drill bit you can get, then try using the point of an awl, or perhaps even a straight pin or sewing needle to make the pilot hole. Getting the new screw started in a pilot hole will ensure that it enters the wood precisely where you want it, and also helps prevent the new screw from stripping out as you drive it in. If you don't plan to install a new screw in the hole, and if you wish to repair the celluloid finish at the hole's location, then snip the plug flush with the surface before the glue dries and use another piece of dowel to force the plug a bit farther into the hole so it ends up very slightly below the surrounding surface. Then use black fingernail polish (or some other matching colour if your accordion is not black) very sparingly just on top of the plug, being careful not to get it on the surrounding celluloid. Don't try to fill the hole with fingernail polish all at once. It is better to build it up in thin layers after each preceding layer dries. When you finally have the fingernail polish flush with the surface, stop. If you have kept the fingernail polish confined to the diameter of the hole, your repair will be small and inconspicuous and will not need further finishing.","title":"Repairing stripped-out wood screws"},{"location":"accordion-repair1/#replacing-a-bellows-gasket","text":"If you have a leak at one of your bellows gaskets, replace the gasket. Pull the bellows pins, split the accordion, and determine whether the gasket is located on the bellows or on the cabinet. The old gasket is likely to be leather, mounted in a 3/16 to 1/4 inch wide shallow channel on the bellows frame, but is sometimes mounted on the treble or bass cabinet. With time, the leather shrinks, the cabinet warps, the bellows frame warps, or the bellows pins loosen up. Whatever the cause, the leather is no longer able to make a good seal. Peel it off and use a narrow flat blade screwdriver or similar scraping tool to remove the residue and the old glue. Take care not to damage the plastic trim bead that usually forms the outer wall of the shallow channel. Replacement gaskets are adhesive backed foam rubber. This material is a bit thicker and more resilient than the original leather, and will seal better. It is available in long rolls in two different widths (3/16\" and 1/4\") from FRM Enterprises in Montreal for $12 or $13 per roll. A roll is enough for several accordions. Just get the roll width that matches your old gasket, cut off what you need, peel off a few inches of one end of the paper backing protecting the adhesive, and press the gasket into place, taking care to keep it properly aligned and lying flat in the channel, peeling off the backing as you go. Try to make the gasket all one piece in order to minimize the chances of a leak at one of the end joints. I begin and end with a steep bevel cut across the gasket to allow a long side by side lap joint where the two ends join. This eliminates the need to cut the new gasket quite as precisely to the correct length. However, simply butting the square cut ends snugly together will suffice, if you get the length cut exactly right. As you round the corners on your bellows frame, stretch it a bit to fit the curve and press it firmly into place a fraction of an inch at a time to ensure a good fit and stable anchorage around the corner. If the gasket surface is double or triple wide along the front of the bass section by the bass switches, simply cut and fit additional strips of the gasket snugly against one another as required to fill the space to the same extent that it was filled by the original gasket. You will occasionally find that the new gasket material is not thick enough to seal the joint. In that case, try applying a second gasket over the first one. If you can get the bellows pins in without excessive force, this double gasket will probably solve the problem. However, if the double gasket turns out to be too thick, that is, if there is danger that forcing the bellows pins into place will enlarge the holes or perhaps split the bellows frame, then peel it all off and start over, looking for a different solution. Check the mating surfaces of the bellows frame and accordion cabinet for warpage with a straight edge. If identifiable high spots are found, sanding them down may provide sufficient room for the double gasket. Also look for screws, brackets, internal microphones, wires, etc. that might be preventing the bellows frame from uniformly and snugly contacting the mating surface in the cabinet. In extreme cases you might lay in a second layer of gasket just where the single thickness gasket continues to leak, thus avoiding excessive pressure on the bellows pins in the areas where a single gasket is thick enough. If you have the thickness just right, when you put the accordion back together you should have to slightly compress the new gasket by pressing down lightly on the treble section in order to allow the bellows pins to be pushed into place with moderate pressure. If they go in too tightly, they might damage the bellows frame. If they go in too loosely, the gasket may still leak. You will be rewarded for getting it right because few things are better than a nice airtight accordion.","title":"Replacing a bellows gasket"},{"location":"accordion-repair1/#repairing-cracked-or-broken-wood","text":"You will probably eventually encounter an accordion with a cracked cabinet, perhaps from being dropped. The most common crack is under the bass cover around the bass cover mounting screws, where the rather fragile wood structure sometimes cracks along a line between the two screws at one end of the cover, so the screws won\u2019t hold. Another fairly common crack is in the wood supporting the lower end of the bass machine, or between the slots in the wooden bass piston guide at the bottom of the pistons. The worst kind of crack is at the corners of the treble cabinet where it joins the bellows, because not only does air leak through the crack, but the resulting loose fit around the bellows frame often causes the bellows gasket to leak, as well. The good news is that nearly all these cracks are repairable, but I have seen some pretty shoddy failed attempts to glue and tape these things together, so I think it might be useful to review the correct way to repair cracked or broken wood. The first rule is that the crack must be glued and clamped. Just pouring glue into the crack will not suffice, as it will create a very weak joint certain to crack open again, probably immediately. For a strong glue joint, the glue must be in a very thin coat over a fairly large area of contact between the two sides of the crack, and allowed to cure overnight under clamping pressure, with the two sides of the crack pressed firmly and tightly together by the clamps. The second rule is that you must have your clamps ready ahead of time so you can set them immediately after you glue the joint. After you have brushed on the glue is not the time to go searching for clamps, nor is it the time to discover that the clamps you have selected will not fit or will not hold, or will not stay in place on a curved surface. All the details of the clamping must be worked out in advance, and the clamps actually installed and tightened before you glue anything, just to make sure it will all work as planned. Once you have proven that your clamping arrangement works, remove the clamps, spread Elmer's wood glue in the joint, and reapply the clamps. Sometimes even this will not hold, especially if the wood is thin and the pressure forcing the crack open is great. Such is the case with cracks at the corner of the treble cabinet where it joins the bellows. The plywood wrap around these corners of the treble cabinet is very thin to allow the bellows frame to fit snugly down inside the cabinet, so the faces on either side of the crack are very small, not affording enough contact area to provide a structurally strong joint if simply glued and clamped. Whenever a simple glued joint will not suffice, you will have to fabricate some kind of doubler across the joint. If it is a wooden doubler or a corner gusset, it, too must be glued and clamped in place after the crack itself is clamped securely closed by its own set of clamps. If there is not room for a wooden doubler or gusset of sufficient thickness and strength (such as at the corners of the treble cabinet facing the bellows), you can fabricate an aluminium corner bracket and glue and screw it in place. In this case, the screws are merely clamps that are left permanently in place. Naturally, the bellows frame will have to be mortised to fit around the aluminium corner bracket, or the bellows frame will not fit back into the treble cabinet. No two cracks are the same, so it is impossible to write detailed instructions that will apply in every case, but walking you through a repair I recently made will help illustrate the basic procedure, and may provide some ideas for repairing the next crack you encounter. Clamping a rounded corner may seem daunting at first, because the usual spring clamps and screw clamps will not fit. But if you are creative, you will figure out some way to clamp it. I used a one inch wide nylon cargo strap around the cabinet, tightened by the little hand winch that comes with the strap. I modified the strap to eliminate the steel hooks, which I feared would mar the accordion finish. I ground off the rivet and removed and discarded the short strap with its hook. Then I removed the hook from the long strap and anchored one end of that strap to the winch with a bolt and nut to replace the rivet I had ground off. I wound the other end of the strap around the spool of the winch and used the winch to tighten the strap around the treble cabinet until the cracked corners closed. Naturally, I had to first remove the bellows strap snaps and shoulder strap brackets to allow the cargo strap to fit snugly against the celluloid finish. I used a soft rag as a pad to protect the celluloid finish from being marred by the metal winch. I found a short piece of scrap aluminium tubing with the same outside radius as the inside radius of the treble cabinet corners. I cut the short length of tubing into quarters, circumference-wise, so each of my corner brackets started out as a 90 degree curve. I trimmed these down to maybe 70 or 80 degree curves on my belt sander, as I wanted them just wide enough to allow getting my screws into solid wood on either side of the crack. I used a centre-punch to locate four holes in each of them, then used my drill press to drill those holes to match the outside diameter of the small brass wood screws I had on hand, which were short enough not to go all the way through the wood. I then used a countersink mounted in the drill press to countersink the heads of the flathead screws flush with the aluminium, so they would not interfere with the bellows frame. With the cargo strap tightened to completely close the cracks, I held the new brackets in place on the accordion with small spring clamps while I used the brackets as templates to drill tiny pilot holes in the wood. After drilling the first pilot hole for each bracket, I put a screw in it to hold the bracket firmly in place while I drilled the rest of them. I wrapped masking tape around my pilot hole drill bit to use as a depth gauge to avoid drilling all the way through to the outside finish, and I drilled by hand, holding and turning the drill chuck with my fingers. Using just two screws to hold each corner bracket in place, I set the bellows in place, marked the bellows frame at the edges of both corner brackets, and used a box cutter to hand carve mortises in the bellows frame corners to accommodate the thickness of the new corner brackets. I removed the corner brackets from the cabinet to use as templates to carve the bellows frame corner to exactly the right curvature and depth for a snug fit. Note that all this was in preparation. Nothing had been glued yet. I released the cargo strap, cut small pieces of waxed paper to fit between the strap and the outside face of the accordion at the cracks, to prevent any glue that might squeeze out of the crack from gluing the strap to the accordion. Only then did I put glue into both cracks, using a narrow piece of .002\u201d metal feeler gauge to work the glue thoroughly down into the bottoms of the cracks. Once I was sure that the entire inside faces of the cracks were thoroughly coated, I put the waxed paper in place and tightened the cargo strap until the cracks were once again completely closed, forcing most of the glue out of the crack. With the cargo strap still firmly tight, I then brushed glue onto the aluminium corner brackets and onto the wood behind them, and installed the screws to clamp them in place. I let the whole thing dry undisturbed overnight. In the morning I released the cargo strap and reinstalled the reed blocks, shoulder strap brackets, bellows strap snaps, and bellows. What the previous day had been a worthless, unplayable, cracked and leaky mess, was now a perfectly playable accordion. I scraped just enough glue out of the cracks to make room for a few thin layers of black nail polish to colour the repair to match the accordion finish. What had been 1/8\u201d wide gaping cracks were now almost invisible. It was a very satisfying repair.","title":"Repairing cracked or broken wood"},{"location":"accordion-repair1/#installing-a-back-pad","text":"One of the easiest and most economical ways to enhance the look and feel of your accordion is to install a back pad, which helps protect the bellows from your clothing and vise-versa. Back pads are normally held on by four snaps. The female halves of the snaps are usually pre-mounted in the back pad, and the male halves of the snaps and the screws for attaching them to the back of the treble keyboard are usually supplied loose with the pad. Make sure the supplied screws are not longer than necessary to penetrate the snap and the wood, as you do not want the screw point interfering with the action of any of the treble keys on the other side. Set the accordion on its feet and position the pad where you want it. Make sure you have the right size pad, as they come in various sizes. The pad should not be so large that it sticks out past either end of the accordion, and it should probably be at least large enough to reach within one inch of either end. I like mine to reach just about to the beginning of the curve on the bellows corners. In the other direction, I like my back pads to extend about an inch past the bass side of the bellows, but many are installed flush with the bass side of the bellows; it\u2019s your choice. You can slide it up or down to suit yourself. Although they are typically installed within an inch or so of the edge of the keyboard, this is not critical, as this part of the accordion does not move much relative to your clothing. Make sure the pad is square with the accordion, then place a one inch square of doubled or tripled masking tape approximately cantered under each of the snaps. You will use these to mark the exact locations for the screw holes. You are doubling it to allow you to make a better impression of the snap in the thicker, more compressible multiple thickness tape. Start by marking just one screw location on the tape. Choose a drill bit no larger than 2/3 the diameter of your screw, and drill the pilot hole very carefully so as not to punch through the thin wood and damage one of the keys on the other side. I drill by hand, using a drill bit and chuck only (no drill motor). The wood is soft and not very thick, so several twists of the drill under moderate pressure should be enough to drill your pilot hole through the tape and the wood. Twist one of your screws partway into the hole to begin cutting the threads, then back it out, remove the tape, put the male snap in place and install the screw. Snug is enough. Don\u2019t over-tighten it, or you may strip the threads out of the thin wood. Snap the back pad onto that snap, position it square with the accordion, and press one of the other snaps hard against its masking tape pad to make a circular impression in the tape. Mark the centre of this circular impression with a pen or pencil, and drill your pilot hole through the mark. Tap the threads and install the snap just as you did with the first one. Repeat with each of the two remaining snaps.","title":"Installing a back pad"},{"location":"accordion-repair2/","text":"Renewing treble valves Renewing, refacing, re-valving; whatever you choose to call it, replacing the felt/leather facing on your treble valves will make your accordion use less air and will reduce the clattering of the keyboard. Old hard felt is less effective as a cushion, and compressed felt allows the key to travel farther and faster before closing. Both factors contribute to a noisy, clunky keyboard. Re-valving and re-levelling will go a long way toward making your keyboard look, feel, and work like new. Begin by removing the treble grille and treble switch assembly, and disassembling the keyboard. Unless your accordion has a tone chamber, you can technically re-valve without disassembling the keyboard, but by taking all the keys out you will be less likely to drop brittle wax debris into your treble register slides or into the reed blocks when you twist off the pallets. This is also your best chance to clean under the treble keys and to clean the spindles, as well as to install new felt stops under the keys, and/or adjust the depth of the keyboard action. See the article on setting up a treble keyboard for specific instructions. Next, measure the thickness of the felt and leather laminate on your treble pallets. Some accordions have different thicknesses on the white and black keys. If your accordion has a tone chamber, the valves in the chamber may have a different thickness facing from those outside the chamber. Technically, you can change these thicknesses, but doing so will significantly increase the amount of bending you will have to do on the key rods. This is particularly troublesome on keys in the black key row, which often have very short rods. If your accordion has just leather facing with no felt cushion behind it, you may choose to add some padding, but the easiest way is to match the original thicknesses. Once you have all the keys out, note how the pallets are fastened to the key rods. Your pallets will most likely be fastened to the rods with reed wax, which will break away fairly easily as you twist the pallet off the rod. However, some pallets have small plastic sleeves that slip over the ends of the key rods, which in most cases slip off and back on fairly easily. A few accordions have the pallets glued to the key rods, in which case this next step may not apply, which is to remove the pallets from the key rods. If they are fastened on with wax, you may be tempted to leave them on to save the work of re-waxing them, but you will probably dislodge some of them during the cleaning process anyway, and once off the rods the pallets are easier to handle, so you might as well take them off right at the beginning. The black key pallets are sometimes a different height, length, and/or width than the white key pallets. If so, keep them separate. Strip the old valve facings off your pallets and scrape off the old glue. Applying heat may help soften the glue, so you might try using the modified soldering iron described in the article on installing a new bellows. Check to make sure pallets are not arched. Place them flat side down on a flat table and try to push a .003\" metal feeler gage under the center and ends. If you find .003\" or more clearance under any part of a pallet, sand it flat. If it is too thin to sand flat, then either replace it or glue on another thin layer and sand that flat. Finish by sanding lightly to cross hatch the surface for better glue adhesion. You want a nice flat, clean surface to apply the new facing. Select the valve facing material of appropriate thickness for each class of pallet. The traditional Italian valve facing material from FRM Enterprises comes in sheets large enough to do a whole accordion for about $18. You will have to cut the sheet into strips of the proper width to fit your pallets. I use a wheel cutter (available in fabric stores for about $20), a metal ruler/straightedge, and the pallet itself to gauge the width of the strip. Once you have it cut into strips, use the wheel cutter and straight edge to cut off lengths to fit your pallets. Your pallets are most likely to be wood, but may also be plastic or metal. If you have metal pallets you may choose to use a thin coat of hot glue or fabric glue for better adhesion, but if you have wood or plastic, use Elmer's white glue. Lay your newly cut valve facings on your work table felt side up. With a small brush, paint an even, thin coat of glue onto the bottom of a pallet. You want thorough coverage, but you don't want to leave any excess glue that might soak into the felt and harden it. Be sure to get the right pallet matched to the right thickness valve facing, then center it carefully over one of your valve facings, press the glued pallet onto the felt, and leave it to dry. Repeat for each pallet. Before proceeding any further, be sure you fully understand the article on setting up a treble keyboard, including its specific instructions on how to set the depth of action and level the keyboard. This is your chance to get your keyboard set up exactly the way you want it. Once you have decided on the proper height for your black keys, install all the black keys (sans pallets) back into the keyboard (if your black and white keys are all on one spindle, you may be tempted to install the white keys also, but you will have an easier time if you don't). Place all the black key pallets into position, carefully centering them over their ports and lining all their front edges up against a straight edge, making sure they won't interfere with operation of the white key pallets. Use your keyboard leveling/bending tools to bend each key rod as required to center it in the groove in the top of its pallet and to cause the rod end to lie level and flat in that groove at the same time that the top of the black key is at the proper height and exactly level with all the others. When you have all the key rods properly adjusted, wax them into the pallets. For details, see the article on waxing with a modified soldering iron. Take special care not to let any molten wax run down the sides of the pallet far enough to foul the felt padding or leather valve facing. If this happens, you will have to replace that leather/felt valve facing (don't panic; it is easy to replace). Even though all pallets were lying flat on their ports when you waxed them in, shrinkage of the wax as it cools might lift one end of the pallet, so check all corners of each valve with a feeler gauge made from a thin piece of paper. Use your bending tools to rotate the pallet as necessary for a perfect seal all around, and to tweak the rod as necessary to center the pallet over its ports, and to get your black keys exactly level. Repeat these same procedures for the white keys, then check for any valves that leak under bellows pressure. Use your paper feeler gauge and your bending tools to diagnose and cure any such leaks, and for a final leveling of the keyboard. When all is well, reinstall the treble switch assembly and treble grille, and play yourself a congratulatory song. Setting up a treble keyboard for shallow action One of the nicest things you can do for yourself if you don't already have it, is to set up your keyboard for nice shallow action. Especially of you play fast or use glissandos in your music, you and those around you will appreciate what a nice shallow action does for your playing. By shallow, I mean somewhere between 3/16 and 1/8 inch, measured right at the end of the white keys. This is clearly a matter of personal preference, but I find anything over 3/16 inch a bit cumbersome, and anything less than 1/8 inch does not provide enough tactile feedback. Besides, some of the valves on your accordion may not open far enough to allow the bassoon reed to sound if you set the action too shallow. By the way, all the following is based on the assumption that your accordion does not have a tone chamber. If it does, the same basic considerations apply, but the job is much more complicated, difficult, and time consuming because each treble key has two valves mounted to it. One of the valves is in the normal position and easy to adjust, but the other is in the tone chamber, where it is difficult to reach and to see, and therefore much more difficult to adjust properly. The challenge is that both valves have to close simultaneously and seal perfectly at the same instant that the key arrives at the correct level with all the other keys. With some experience and the right tools this challenge is manageable, but the first keyboard you set up should probably not be on an accordion with a tone chamber. Since this article is directed primarily toward those who have not previously set up a keyboard, it is tailored to non- tone chamber accordions. To find the minimum practical white key travel for your accordion, remove the treble grille and identify all the white keys (if any) that have short key rods with their valves located in the black key row, nearest the keyboard. If you have a normal full size 41/120 accordion with 19\" keyboard, you probably will not find any. But if you have a ladies' size or intermediate size, or if you have an extended keyboard with more than 41 notes, you will very likely find that from 1 to 3 of your white keys have stubby little key rods. They are usually C keys or E keys. The problem is that due to their shorter lever arm these valves do not open as far as the other white key valves for the same amount of key deflection, and if you make the action too shallow, they may not open far enough to allow enough air to flow through the reeds behind them to properly sound the bassoon reed, which requires more air than the others. This is particularly troublesome if the bassoon reeds are located at the rearmost ports because the rear of the pallet, being closer to the fulcrum, does not lift as far off the ports. Some accordion designers eliminate this problem by using compound levers on some or all of these keys. They attach the valve to a long lever hinged at the forward side of the foundation plate. This lever is lifted near its center by the stubby key rod, thus doubling the lift on the valve. If your accordion has no white key valves in the black key row, or if it has compound levers on those notes, you can relax, because the lower practical limit of white key travel is lower than you would want it in any case. But if you find one or more without compound levers, choose the lowest of those notes to test. With the Master switch on, and with light bellows pressure, play that note normally and measure the depth of the key deflection required to make all the reeds on that note respond satisfactorily. This is the minimum practical key travel for this key, and unless you want to make the stop under this key lower than all the other key stops (not recommended), it is the minimum practical travel for all of your white keys. Next, decide how shallow you want your key action to be. As long as that measurement is greater than your practical minimum, you have no worries. If it is less than your practical minimum, you will either have to compromise or redesign your accordion to have compound levers. Whichever course you choose, the white key travel you select is the basis for the rest of your work on this project. There are two ways to limit the key travel to your chosen value. You can limit how far up the keys can travel, and you can limit how far down they can travel. You will probably do a little of both. Upward travel is adjusted by bending the key rod. When the valve is closed, the key is just so high, and cannot go higher without bending the rod. (see the article on bending key rods and making bending tools). You will bend the key rods to set the key height exactly where you want it, usually flush with the ends of the keyboard cabinet. This usually looks the best, and is also very convenient, because you can simply place a long straightedge across all the keys, resting directly on top of the cabinet at each end and bend the key rods until all the keys just barely touch the straightedge and are not deflected by the straightedge when you press the straightedge down onto the ends of the cabinet. Any resulting movement is very easy to see, so this method allows very precise keyboard leveling. Make your initial bends as close as possible to the keys, and as far as possible from the pallets. If significant bending is required, you will find that one end or the other of the pallet has lifted off the foundation plate, which, if uncorrected, will cause the valve to leak. Make your second bend to correct this as close to the pallet as possible. Naturally, this second bend will impact the level of your key, so you will have to make another bend as close to the key as possible to correct that. You may go back and forth several times before you finally get it right. The point to remember is that bends made to raise or lower the key should be made close to the key, and bends to rock the pallet into parallel with the foundation plate should be made close to the pallet. Check all corners of each pallet with a feeler gauge cut from thin paper. For a perfect seal, you want to feel equal drag on the paper as you pull it out from under each corner. Once you have leveled your keyboard (set the upward limit of white key travel and got every valve sealing perfectly), the next step is to take out all the treble keys (see the article on disassembling the treble keyboard). Also remove the long felt strip (key cushion/key stop), which you will find glued to the cabinet under the ends of the white key bodies, and the short felt or leather key cushions/stops glued to the cabinet at the end of each black key slot. Scrape off any old glue and felt residue. As you have surmised by now, the downward travel is limited by felt stops (cushions) placed under the keys (green in the photo below). The stops are under the key body, not under the keytop overhangs at the ends of the white keys. Putting stops under the white keytop overhangs is a sure fire recipe for broken or delaminated keytops. If you have a wooden keyboard like the one above, you will notice that the keyboard cabinet slots for the black keys are shorter than the slots for the white keys. Assuming you made sure your keys were numbered as you took them out, by counting short slots and long slots up from the bottom of the keyboard you can easily determine which keys go where. If your keyboard is aluminum, the slots may all look the same, in which case you will have to count more carefully, especially if your white and black keys have separate numbering systems. Install a white key and an immediately adjacent black key in their proper positions near the center of the keyboard. You are choosing the approximate middle in order to be able to see and measure under the keys, and to be able to test various thicknesses of key stop material without taking the keys out each time. You are placing a black key immediately adjacent to a white key to allow setting the black key upward travel limit at the point where the top of the black key is exactly parallel to the top of the white key when they are both at their upward travel limits. When you have properly adjusted that black key's upward limit, measure the difference in height between the white and black keys at rest against their upward stops (i.e., with both of their valves closed). Fabricate two wooden shims exactly this height by about 1/2 inch wide and 2 inches long. You will eventually tape these shims onto the cabinet ends in line with the ends of the black keys, so the straightedge can be rested on these shims while you level the black keys. The next steps are to select the right combination of materials to use as white key stops to limit their downward travel to exactly the distance you selected early on, and to select the correct materials to use as black key stops to prevent the black keys from submerging below the level of the white keys when the white keys are at rest at their upward limit (you don't want excessive black key travel to cause you to inadvertently depress a white key while playing). The single white key and black key you have installed are your test beds for selecting the right material thicknesses. If the clearance under your single white key (measured at the future key stop location) is not more than 1/8 inch in excess of your chosen key travel dimension, you can use felt of the correct thickness to stop your key where you want it to stop. However, it may not be wise to use felt thicker than 1/8 inch, because it will compress too much, giving the keyboard a mushy feel. In case the clearance under your white key is more than 1/8 inch in excess of your chosen key travel distance, you will need to fabricate a long wooden shim of the correct thickness and width to be glued and clamped in place under the 1/8\" felt white key stop. Select your black key stop material in the same way, and cut individual pieces to glue into place, using one of the old stops as a pattern. These are in a much more difficult place to clamp, so if your shims (if any) are not too thick, consider making them of scrap leather and gluing them to the wood with fabric glue, which sets much more quickly. If you make your new black key stops wider or longer than the originals, take care that they will not interfere with the operation of the black keys or the adjacent white keys. Try your various shims and cushion (key stop) materials under your test keys before gluing anything in place. Once you are happy with your selection, remove your test keys and glue and clamp the long wooden shim in place (if you are using one) using Elmer's wood glue or equal, and glue your black key shims (if any) in place with the glue of your choice. When the glue has dried, glue your chosen felt key cushions/stops on top of the shims, using a very light coat of Elmer's, wood glue so as not to allow excess glue to soak into the felt and harden it. If you are also changing the felt trim under the white key overhangs, now is the time to do it. Now you are ready. Install the black keys first and use your bending tools to level them (with the wooden shims taped in place under the ends of the straightedge, naturally). As with the white keys, bends made to raise or lower the key should be made close to the key, and bends to rock the pallet into parallel with the foundation plate should be made close to the pallet. This is particularly challenging on black keys with short key rods, but avoid the temptation to hold the key and bend the rod. If you have an old style wooden key with the key rod driven into it like a nail, this could tear the rod out of the key, or loosen it, which opens an entirely new can of worms. If you have aluminum key rods that extend all the way through the key, you may overstress the key hinge. Stick to the standard procedure, which is to grip the rod with two bending tools, one on either side of the point where you want it to bend. If this standard procedure is clearly not working, then the nuclear solution is to twist the pallet off the key rod, clean all the old wax out of the pallet and revalve it, as the old valve facing is likely to have a waffle pattern impressed into it by the ports under it, and you will probably not be able to get it precisely back into position to seal properly (see the article on renewing treble valves). With the pallet off, use pliers on the end of the key rod to bend it into the proper position to lie flat in the slot on top of the re-valved pallet when the key is level. When you have it right, center the pallet over its ports, align it with neighboring pallets, and wax the key rod back into the pallet. Once you have your black keys level and sealing perfectly, reinstall the white keys, which were previously leveled. Play the accordion to check for leaks. If any leaks are felt or heard, first try high inward bellows pressure with the Master switch on to see if enough air is leaking to sound a reed, in which case you can identify the note by ear. Be aware that you will be hearing the piccolo reed, so the leak may be an octave or two farther down the keyboard (pitch-wise) than you initially think. With the grille still off, you should be able to identify the leaking pallet by pressing down on it to see if that temporarily stops the leak. When you have identified it, adjust it to seal properly using the procedures above. If you cannot readily identify the leaking note by pitch, set the accordion on its feet and use the bellows leak down procedure described in the article on finding leaks. When you finally have eliminated all leaks, put the grille back on and use your nice shallow keyboard action to play your favorite song. Waxing with a modified soldering iron When you need to wax but the job is too small to justify firing up your wax pot, use a modified 15 watt soldering iron. Bigger irons produce too much heat and will cause your wax to smoke, driving off volatile compounds and causing premature aging and embrittlement of the wax. Even a 15 watt iron produces too much heat unless you modify the tip to dissipate it. Make a heat sink/waxing tip from a piece of copper flashing and rivet it to your soldering tip. Longer soldering tips are better because they allow more secure mounting of the heat sink. The heat sink should be approximately 3/4 inch wide by 1 1/4 inch long. Remove the insulation from a short piece of solid (not stranded) copper electrical wire and cut it into two short lengths to use as rivets. Before removing the soldering tip from the iron, file one side of the last 3/4 inch of it flat to provide more bearing surface for the heat sink. Then drill two holes in it the same diameter as the wire, with the holes centered on the flat surface and 1/2 inch apart. Hold the copper heat sink firmly against the flat side of the soldering tip and use the holes in the soldering tip as a template to drill matching holes along the longest centerline of the heat sink. Clean off all burrs, then place the heat sink back on the flat side of the soldering tip, align the holes, and install the rivets. Trim the rivets so they protrude about one wire diameter beyond the assembled waxing tip on each side. Hold the heat sink and soldering tip firmly together while you set the rivets with a few light taps of a hammer on an anvil. The rivets should flare to about 1.5 times their original diameter. Reinstall the finished tip into the soldering iron, and you are ready to go. For this kind of waxing you need to have your wax formed into rods about the diameter of a pencil so you can melt the wax against the waxing tip and feed it into the work as it melts. Line a wide, shallow flat bottomed container with waxed paper. Pour hot wax into the container to a depth of about 1/4 inch. After it cools, cut it into strips about 1/4 inch wide and peel them off the waxed paper. Alternatively, you can set your block of reed wax in the sun to warm it to near body temperature, then cut off pieces to roll between your palms until they are the size and shape you want. You can use this waxing iron to deliver molten wax to precisely where you want it. Just plug in the iron a few minutes ahead of time so it can come to operating temperature before you begin. Place the hot waxing tip into the area requiring wax and feed the end of a wax rod into the tip, just as you would feed solder or welding rod into a soldered or welded joint. This works very well for sealing air leaks, for waxing pallets to key rods, and for waxing in a few reed plates. You can even wax an entire reed block this way, but the work goes faster with a wax pot and waxing spoon. That operation is described in another article. Adjusting key tension While you have your keys out is an excellent time to adjust your key tension, especially if high or uneven key pressures are making your accordion hard to play. Key tension is adjusted by bending the key springs. Grip the free leg of the spring as close to the coil as possible (but not through the coil) with needle-nose pliers and bend that leg with your fingers. Bend it toward the fixed leg to reduce the required key pressure; bend it away to increase the pressure. With the key below, changing the spring angle from about 90 degrees to about 45 degrees reduced the key pressure from 5 ounces to 2 1/2 ounces. I have seen accordions requiring as much as 5 or 6 ounces to depress a key (very hard to play), but I prefer key pressures in the neighbourhood of 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 ounces. I try to set the key springs to allow the key to start moving at about 2 1/2 ounces of pressure and to be fully open at about 3 1/2 ounces. Don't be tempted to reduce the pressure much below that, because weaker springs don't seal the valves as well and don't return the keys as quickly. You can easily make a simple scale to measure key pressure. I used a weak coil spring that I made by winding .025\" diameter stainless steel wire tightly around a 5/16\" bolt. I used some recycled plastic parts to make my scale plunger and housing, but you can just as easily make yours from wood or metal. As the left end of the plunger presses on the key, the spring tends to resist the travel of the plunger through the housing. As the coil spring compresses, the length of the plunger emerging through the top of the housing is directly proportional to the pressure on the plunger. Lines marked around the perimeter of the plunger indicate how far the plunger has traveled relative to the housing, and thus how many ounces of pressure you are putting on the key. You can use a postage scale to calibrate your scale in ounces, or you can calibrate it using the keys of an accordion whose key pressure you like, simply by marking a line on your plunger at the point where spring pressure of your scale begins to open those keys. I wrapped a gummed paper label around my plastic plunger, and marked my 2, 3, 4, and 5 ounce lines on that. My green housing is a plastic drive gear from an old fax paper roll, but you can use anything handy. Just drill a hole through it large enough for your plunger to pass with very little friction. A washer to retain the bottom of the spring, and a couple of wire pins installed through holes drilled through the plastic plunger complete the design. Waxing with a wax pot and spoon In the accordion factories in Castelfidardo, they still wax reeds into the reed blocks with a wax pot and spoon. Prior to visiting there, I found it difficult to wax with a spoon, and preferred to use an eye dropper. However, the eye dropper is not without its problems, most notably the frequency with which it clogs up with wax that cools within it. I was therefore quite happy to observe and learn how to properly use the spoon. Properly used, it is a fast and convenient way to wax reeds into their reed blocks. Think of the spoon as a fountain pen. The flat sides of the spoon are its reservoir, and the forward point is the pen point. Heat the spoon in the wax pot until it matches the temperature of the wax. This takes only a few seconds. Withdraw the spoon, shake off some of the excess wax with one quick, light shake, and immediately rotate it to the horizontal. In this position the wax adheres to the sides of the spoon. As you rotate the rounded edge up toward the vertical, the molten wax flows toward the straight edge on the bottom. As you tip the point downward, the wax flows along the straight edge toward the pen point. By coordinating this rotation and tipping you can precisely control the rate at which wax runs off the point. Use this \"fountain pen\" to \"write\" the wax onto the work. To stop the flow, simultaneously tip the point back up to level and rotate the spoon back to horizontal. When it runs out of wax, dip it into the wax pot again. The people in the factories wax very quickly by rotating the reed block around in one hand to cause the molten wax to flow along the channels between adjacent reeds. This allows them to use the spoon at near maximum capacity. I have not yet developed this coordination skill, so I hold the reed block level and still, while I move the spoon along the channels, frequently rotating it around to deliver the wax at a slower rate. Even so, this is much faster than using the soldering iron with the modified waxing tip (see the article on waxing with a modified soldering iron). For a wax pot I use a small (1 quart) electric \"crock pot\" slow cooker. I use the high heat setting initially to melt the wax, then turn it down to low. If left on high, my pot will overheat the wax, causing it to smoke as the more volatile compounds are driven off by the excess heat. If allowed to continue, this smoking would cause premature aging and embrittlement of the wax. The best temperature for the wax is around 220 degrees Fahrenheit. At this temperature it is thin enough to flow freely, yet not hot enough to smoke. It is also hot enough to burn you pretty badly if you spill it on yourself, so be careful. And always keep in mind that wax is flammable. Keep open flames away from your wax pot. I buy my reed wax already mixed in one pound bricks from Frank Romano of FRM Enterprises in Montreal for about $19 per pound. I think Frank currently has a $300 minimum order, so check his online catalog for other things you might need (he is a good source for high quality reasonably priced shoulder straps, bass straps, felt/leather valve facing material, and just about anything else you might need to repair your accordion). You can also mix your own reed wax. There are various formulas in use, but all are mostly beeswax, with varying percentages of pine resin and a small amount of linseed oil. I have no experience mixing my own, and therefore cannot advise you on the exact proportions to use. Making an over-size air release valve After playing a Giulietti or a Petosa with their relatively large air release valves which allow closing the bellows quickly and easily with a minimum of whooshing noise, I always felt rather let down to have to go back to a normal accordion with its pathetically small, slow, and noisy air valve. When I push that air release button I want instant results. So I enlarged the air release valves on all my favorite accordions. Now I can close my bellows quickly and quietly. Open the accordion at the bass side, take out the bass reed blocks and set the bass cabinet bellows-side-down on the work bench. Remove the bass cover and locate your air release valve, button, and linkage. Examine both sides of the bass foundation plate right around the valve port, note any obstacles (reed block mountings, register slide linkages, bass strap adjustment screw, etc., and decide whether there is room to enlarge the valve, how much, and in which directions. Take into account the need for the linkage arm to reach across the center of the new larger pallet, and for the pallet to lift off its port when you push the air release button. Scavenge a bass pallet from a junk accordion, strip off the old valve facing, wax, and glue, and reface it with new felt/leather laminate. See the article on re-valving for more specific instructions. Remove the old air release valve by twisting it off its linkage arm. Place your new valve over the hole in the position you want it to occupy, re-bend the linkage arm as required to fit, including a vertical jog if the new pallet is taller than the original, and trace the valve perimeter with a pencil. Take out the new valve and its linkage and mark the perimeter of the enlarged hole you want to make, keeping it a minimum of 1/8 inch inside the previous tracing, so your new valve will have at least 1/8inch bearing/sealing surface all around the new hole. Use a round file such as a chainsaw file to enlarge the old hole out to your latest markings. Clean up all the sawdust, place the new valve into position, centered within its previously traced outline. Reinstall the linkage, check the height of the air release button, and bend the linkage arm as required to set the button at the correct height relative to the bass cover. Use your modified soldering iron to wax the pallet to its linkage arm (see the article on waxing with a modified soldering iron for more details). Reinstall the bass cover, reinstall the bass reed blocks, reattach the bass cabinet to the rest of the accordion, and test the operation of your new air release valve. The basics of this procedure can be used to add an air release button to an accordion that does not have one. In this case, you can either scavenge the linkage and button from a junk accordion and modify it to fit, or you can fabricate a new linkage assembly from scratch. If you fabricate from scratch, see the article on replacing bass buttons for tips on how to install the button onto your new linkage. Installing rhinestones on bass buttons Most accordions came from the factory with a dimple on the C button, but many of us also like some tactile identification of the Ab and E buttons. It is fairly easy to add rhinestones to these buttons. It is even easier to just dimple them, but I think it is useful to have a unique tactile cue on the C, so I generally use rhinestones on the other two. To install a rhinestone you must first dimple the button by drilling a conical hole in the top of it, then glue a conical glass rhinestone into the hole, so if you want dimples, you just omit the rhinestones. Whatever the final goal, the drill tends to push the button down, so if the button is still mounted in the accordion, you need some way to hold the button up while you drill. I use a hemostat that I have modified to have a circular gripping surface to minimize damage to the sides of the button. I put the hemostat loosely in place, forcing some neighboring buttons down flush so the hemostat can lie flat on the bass board and grip the Ab or E button near the bottom. Then I clamp the hemostat in place to keep the gripped button from depressing. On accordions it is always best to drill by hand. For most drilling I use a drill chuck taken from an old drill motor to grip the drill bit and I turn it by hand. For drilling bass buttons I have a modified (sharpened to 45 degree angle, rather than the standard 30 degree) 5/32\" drill bit mounted rigidly in a brass knob, with a close fitting rigid plastic tube around the drill bit to act as a stop, allowing the drill to penetrate only to the depth of the conical back of the rhinestone. If you drill too deeply, the rhinestone might not stick up far enough to be noticed. The short piece of thin walled brass tubing fits over both the button and the plastic tube to keep the drill bit centered on the button. Alternatively, I sometimes drill a small pilot hole in the center of the button, then enlarge the hole with the 5/32\" drill bit. In this case the pilot hole keeps the drill centered. Of course, all this is even easier if you have the piston out of the accordion, and it is not too hard to get them out, if you are so inclined. Just remove the note piston cap strip, as in the photo below, lift the desired piston out of its slot and fish it out through the top of the bass keyboard. It will take a little patience to get it back in and properly engaged with its bell crank lever, but the ease of drilling your button in a bench vise makes it worthwhile. When I have drilled to the desired depth, I put a small drop of Superglue into the hole and set the rhinestone in place. In just a minute or two it sets and the accordion is ready to play. To minimize the chances of gluing your fingers together, it is a good idea to wear latex gloves when working with Superglue. I handle the rhinestones by sticking a small screwdriver to the top of the rhinestone with a bit of reed wax, leaving the conical bottom clean for best adhesion. I use a wooden toothpick to press the rhinestone down and free it from the screwdriver, then to clean up any excess superglue that oozes out from under the rhinestone before it dries. I use 4.0-4.1mm Swarovski crystal rhinestones from Fire Mountain Gems. You can order online at firemountaingems.com. Order stock number H20-4835CY for clear, order stock number H20-4843CY for emerald. Other colors are available. They cost a little over a dollar for each package of 12, but the shipping on my last order was $7.65, so to minimize your average cost get lots of them. Use a 5/32\u201d (4mm) drill bit (sharpened to 45 degrees) with a stop set to allow you to drill only as deep as the tapered point. This gives the correct angle and depth of hole to fit the conical back of the rhinestones. Here is a nice clean installation. Replacing bellows tape Bellows tape serves to strengthen the bellows folds, protect the cardboard from abrasion, and enhance the appearance of the accordion. Keeping the bellows tape in good shape can prolong the life of the bellows. It is normally stuck to the underlying bellows fabric with a glue that allows it to be peeled off without damaging that fabric, so when your bellows tape becomes tattered and frayed, you can peel it off and replace it without destroying the bellows. Replacing bellows tape is time consuming and therefore expensive if you have someone else do it, but it is not difficult to do yourself. Bellows tape is available in 19mm wide x 50 meter rolls in a variety of colors from Frank Romano of FRM Enterprises in Montreal, for about $36 per roll. I think FRM requires a minimum order of $300, so you will have to combine your tape order with some other items to make it economical, or find another source. The first step is to prop the bellows open. Pull all the bellows pins (keeping them in order) and separate the bellows from the treble and bass cabinets, marking it as necessary to allow you to reassemble it in the correct orientation later. Cut two pieces of 1/8 inch plywood or masonite particle board about 3 inches wide x about 1/2 inch less than the outside width of your bellows. These should be made to fit snugly into the interior folds of your bellows, one at each end so they can be used to hold the bellows open while you work. Drill a 1/2 inch diameter hole at the exact center of each piece. Cut a piece of 1x1 wood molding about 14 inches long and make a tapered point on each end, to fit into the holes. Insert the plates into the last fold at each end of the bellows, stretch the bellows open, and insert the pointed rod into both holes. This should hold the bellows open while you work. The second step is to remove all the old tape and glue. Slip a dull blade under the corners at each end of a tape to allow you to grasp the tape with your fingers and peel it off. Smooth the underlying surface as well as you can without damaging the underlying fabric, because any irregularities or lumps you leave will telegraph through the new tape. Choose one side of the bellows to do on the first day. If you are not yet good at this, it might be wise to start with the back. Mark all the metal corners with a pen or with a straight row of short pieces of masking tape so you can keep the ends of your tape well aligned and flush with those markings. Cut your new bellows tapes to the right length to fit the folds on the bellows side you have chosen. Fold each tape in half the short way and put a firm crease down the middle of it to help keep it centered along the bellows fold. Lay five or six of the tapes out upside-down on a sheet of masking paper or newspaper and apply the glue to the tapes with a small brush. Use the special bellows tape glue from FRM Enterprises, which is designed to release, making your bellows repairable in the future. If you use Elmer's or something similar, the next time someone needs to change a metal corner or repair your tape, they will not be able to do it without damaging the bellows fabric and perhaps even the cardboard, and that will be the end of the bellows. Using the creases as your guide, center the first tape on a bellows fold with both ends aligned with your markings on the metal corners and press it firmly into place, using a damp cloth between your fingers and the tape. The tape will tend to flex back open until the glue begins to set, so you may have to repeat this a few times until it finally holds. When you have the first five or six tapes installed in this manner, run the damp cloth over them all once more to wipe away any excess glue, and repeat the process with five or six more tapes. When you have all the tapes installed and all the excess glue cleaned off, remove your interior props, close the bellows, and place a 30 pound weight on it (another accordion in its hard case works well), and let the glue cure overnight. The next day repeat this process for the next side and so on until you have all four sides done. You will notice that the end folds are a special case. These folds (like all the rest) were taped before the bellows was glued to the bellows frame, so nearly half the tape is stuck in the glued joint and will have to remain there. You cannot pry this joint apart without destroying the bellows. The best you can do is to cut these tapes a bit narrower and tuck one edge of the tape as far down into the glued joint as you can without damaging the joint. Alternatively, if the tape on these folds is not damaged and if you are re-taping with the same color tape, you might consider leaving the end folds alone. If you want to put a design into your bellows tape with a contrasting color, install the design first, using short tape segments, then cut your regular tape to length to fit all around it (butting up to it) and install that last. Do not install the design on top of your regular tape, as this double taping will thicken your bellows so your bellows straps will no longer close. New bellows tape can be applied over old bellows tape, and wider than normal tape (24mm wide) is made for this purpose. However, if you take this shortcut you will have to move your bellows straps and/or snaps, or replace them with longer straps. In that case, you will have some old screw holes to fill, including repair of the celluloid finish. For suggestions on how to do that repair, see the article on repairing stripped out screws. Replacing bass buttons It is not unusual to have to replace a bass button or two. Some prior owner may have butchered the button trying to mark it in some way. I have seen them with notches sawn into them apparently with a hacksaw, creases melted into the top apparently with a hot knife, and even with one side melted away where some misguided soul apparently touched it with a hot soldering iron. I have seen oversize jewels glued on top, and huge dimples drilled into the wrong buttons. I have also seen several buttons scratched and scraped, apparently by sliding on concrete or asphalt. Whatever the problem is, it can usually be solved by replacing the button. If your buttons are black, finding a matching button will be fairly easy. Just make sure you get the correct diameter. The height is not so critical, as the depth of the piston insertion into the button can be varied to make up the difference. If your buttons are red, gold, or some other color, getting an exact match will be difficult. Cerini in Castelfidardo sells new buttons, and so does FRM Enterprises in Montreal, but color choices are limited. Look first to any junk accordion you or your local repairman might have lying around. Junk accordions should never be thrown away, as they are excellent sources of hard to find parts and materials, including bass buttons. Once you have your replacement buttons in hand, disassemble your bass machine to the extent required to extract the pistons with damaged buttons (see the article on disassembling and reassembling bass machines). Carefully measure the overall length of the piston/button assemblies so you will be able to push the new buttons onto the pistons just far enough to match this overall length for each piston. To remove the old button, hold the piston with the damaged button in the fingers of one hand and twist and pull the button off with the other hand. If it will not come off, clamp the piston into a bench vise, or into a vise-grip pliers, which in turn is to be clamped into the bench vise (taking care not to bend the piston or to damage any if the pins or dogs pressed or stamped into the side of it), and heat the side of the piston with a soldering iron until the plastic or glue begins to soften just enough to allow you to pull the button off. Once you have the old button off, measure the diameter of the end of the piston that must go into the new button. Drill or ream the pilot hole in the bottom of the new button to exactly this diameter if you intend to glue it, or to just a few thousandths of an inch smaller if you intend to weld it (that is, if you intend to heat the piston to the melting temperature of the plastic button and force it into the pilot hole in the button, so that as the melted plastic around the pilot hole cools, it will adhere to the piston). In either case, drill or ream your pilot hole to a depth 1/16 inch greater than that theoretically necessary to allow pushing the piston into the button far enough to make the new assembly exactly the same length as your pattern. This allows room for some small amount of plastic or glue that may be pushed to the bottom of the pilot hole by the advancing piston. Whether you choose to glue or weld, the next step is to install the button onto the piston, taking care to make the overall length exactly match your previous measurement. When the plastic cools, or the glue dries, as the case may be, reassemble your bass machine, taking special care to ensure that every button goes exactly back where it came from and that every pin or dog on each piston properly engages its bell-crank levers. Reinstall the bass reed blocks, the bass cover and the bass strap, and reinstall the assembled bass cabinet onto the bellows. Check the bass machine for proper operation to make sure no buttons are sticking and all chord buttons are playing all the correct notes. Disassembling a bass machine For various reasons, you may have to remove or disassemble a bass machine. For instance, if one or more bass valves is leaking and you are unable to solve the problem working from the reed block side, then the bass machine will have to be totally removed to gain access to the bass valves. If your bass machine is not removable as a unit, then you will have to disassemble it piece by piece. Other problems that can require at least partial disassembly of the bass machine include a bass valve hanging open due either to sticking \"pipes\" (bass valve bellcranks), worn cam levers on the pipes, or worn valve lifters (cam followers) on the valves. You might also encounter a broken actuating lever on one of the pipes, cracked or broken wood mountings for the bass machine, or pistons bent too badly to straighten without removing them first. Whatever the reason for disassembling your bass machine, you must make sure that you will be able to put it back together correctly, as each of the (usually 120) bass button pistons and each of the (usually 24) pipes is unique, and must go back in its original position. The easiest way to do this is to make a rack to hold the bass button/pistons in their proper positions relative to one another as you take them out. I drilled seven rows of twenty holes in three pieces of plywood that I then stacked with spacers between, to provide a separate chamber for each button from any accordion up to 140 bass. An easier way, if you have a junk accordion, is to salvage and use the bass keyboard, which already has the 120 holes drilled in it. After you remove your bass strap and bass plate, your bass machine should look something like this. Before you begin the disassembly, take a few moments to observe how your bass machine is constructed and how it works. This will help you understand how to keep its various parts in order and how to put it back together. By observing and understanding, you will also learn some things about accordion design and how the bass machine is really a simple mechanical computer that assembles chords on command. After going through this little exercise, whenever you look at a bass machine you will see order and symmetry and an elegant design, rather than the chaos and unfathomable complexity that you may be seeing now. Take your time. Relax. Get in touch with yourself and your machine. It is a beautiful machine that makes beautiful music, and in a few moments you will understand how it does it. With the bass cover off, push any bass chord button and observe that the button is on the top end of a long piston which has three pegs or tabs along one side of it (some older accordions have four pegs or tabs on their seventh chord pistons). Observe that each peg contacts a lever and forces that lever to move with the piston. Observe that there are four neat rows of levers, all lined up with four neat rows of pegs on the pistons. Notice that the bottom end of the piston passes through a slot in a wooden guide, and that the bottom of the piston has a sharp 90 degree bend to prevent the piston from coming out of the slot when valve spring pressure forces the piston upward as you release the button. Rest the tip of a small screwdriver or similar tool against the bottom end of the piston (90 degree bend) and rest your finger on the button at the top end. Rock the piston gently up (toward the button end) and down and notice that there is a small amount of clearance between each peg and the lever it engages, and that you can therefore rock the piston up and down by some slight amount without causing any levers to move. Notice that each piston has four possible locations for pegs or tabs, that only three of them are used, and that the position not occupied by a peg varies from piston to piston. As you peer down into the bass machine, notice the other tiers of pistons nestled beneath the top tier. Also notice that every second piston (button) in the top tier passes through a hole in the diminished chord row of the bass keyboard, and that the ones in between pass through holes in the seventh chord row. Notice that in the second tier down, every second piston (button) passes through a hole in the minor chord row, and that the ones in between pass through holes in the major chord row. Notice that each piston has a slightly different bend in it in order to accommodate this arrangement. Looking farther down inside the bass machine, you can see a tier of longer pistons with its own slotted wooden guide, and you will notice that every second piston (button) in this tier passes through a hole in the fundamental bass row and the ones in between pass through holes in the counterbass row. As you press one of these fundamental bass or counterbass note buttons, you will observe that the single peg (or tab) on the side of its piston engages a single lever and causes it to move with the piston. Notice that the bottom end of that lever is fixed to one of 12 slender steel rods (technically bell cranks, but commonly called pipes) lying under the pistons, and that this pipe rotates when the lever moves. With a bright light illuminating the area directly under these pipes, observe that as the pipe rotates, one of the 12 note pallets lifts, opening a note valve, and as it opens it also lifts an adjacent chord valve pallet. Find the fundamental bass note button (not the counterbass button) that opens the valve at one end of the pipes (where it is easiest to see) and observe that the pipe has a short cam lever on it that lifts a cam follower on that note pallet arm, opening the note valve as the pipe rotates. Notice that the note pallet arm extends past the end of the pallet and engages the underside of a similar extension on the chord pallet arm, causing the chord valve to open whenever the note valve opens. Now press the major chord button next to that same fundamental bass button, and watch the chord valve open while the corresponding bass note valve stays closed. Do the same, one at a time, with the minor, seventh, and diminished buttons in that same diagonal row of buttons (chord family). Notice that in each case the first pipe rotates, forcing its cam lever to lift the chord pallet, thereby opening the chord valve, and realize that this chord valve is for the root note of all the chords in this chord family. Understand that this particular pipe and its cam lever, along with two of its levers that engage pegs on these four pistons, cause the bass machine to play the root note whenever you push one of these chord buttons. As you press each of these chord buttons a second time, use your bright light to observe which other two valves open, along the row of 12 chord valves. Understand that these other two valves are the other two notes that join the root note to make up each of these chords. Observe that each valve is operated by only one cam lever and pipe, but that each pipe has many levers on it, each extending upward to engage a peg on the side of a chord piston that uses that particular note. Focus on just one of these pipes for a moment. Push one of its levers downward (away from the bass buttons) and observe how many other levers move with it, and which pistons have pegs that engage these levers. Whenever any one of those particular chord buttons/pistons is pushed, one of the pegs on the side of its piston engages one of the levers on this pipe, causing this particular pipe to rotate and the valve it controls to open. The other two pegs on that piston each engage a lever protruding from one of the other two pipes whose notes comprise the chord played by that button. Notice that there are 12 chord valves and 12 chord pipes, and that there are also 12 note valves and 12 note pipes. The note pipes operate the valves that control the two lowest octaves in your bass reed set, while the chord pipes operate the valves that control the (usually two or three) higher octaves. Each pipe in each set of 12 pipes is dedicated to a single note of the 12 note chromatic scale. Chords are played by rotating three pipes simultaneously, thus opening three separate valves. The bass machine assembles chords for you by opening the three correct note valves whenever you press any single chord button. Just as the chord valves and note valves are arranged in your bass machine, so are the reeds arranged in your bass reed blocks, because directly behind each valve lie the reeds for that note. Therefore, if your chord valves line up with your note valves (on some Russian accordions they don't), then all the reeds for that note line up across the various reed blocks. In other words, if the first reed in one reed block is Bb, then the first reed in each of the other reed blocks is also Bb, although in another octave. You can use this knowledge to determine how the bass reeds are organized within each reed block. Some accordions have their bass reeds organized in chromatic scale order, while some have them arranged in accordance with the circle of fifths. You can easily determine which system you have by observing the operation of your bass machine. Press your C note button and observe which valve opens. Now press the F or the G button. If a valve right next to the C valve opens, your bass reeds are arranged in accordance with the circle of fifths. If you must press a B button a C# button to get this valve to open, then your bass reeds are arranged in chromatic scale order. Either way, by identifying which button operates the valve at each end of your 12-valve array, and therefore which note lies at each end of the row of valves, you can now fill in the names of all the notes in between. With this knowledge, you can see which three notes are being played by each chord button. This is academic, I know, but if you have gone this far, and used your knowledge of the bass machine to deduce the arrangement of your bass reeds and to determine which notes comprise each chord, then you are to be congratulated for being truly in touch with your machine. You can now safely disassemble your bass machine with confidence that you will be able to get it back together correctly, so let us begin. In order to get the pistons out, you must first remove the cap strip (usually wood) over the guide slots at the bottom of the pistons. It is usually held in place by four or five small brass wood screws. Removing this cap strip allows the diminished and seventh chord buttons to be lifted out of their slots. Pull the buttons down into their holes as you remove the pistons one by one and place them in your rack. However, the minor and major chord buttons cannot be removed until first removing a thin plastic barrier that rests in a slot in the button side of the slotted wooden guide. Sometimes this plastic separator is held in place by several short narrow strips of plastic glued across the outside of the slot. In other cases it is held in place by tiny nails or by friction alone. When you get all the chord buttons out, you will have to remove their slotted wooden guide, which is held in by two large wood screws, one at either end. Once this is out, you will have access to the note buttons, which are retained by their own separate cap strip, which also must be removed. In most accordions it is easier to take the note buttons out through the top of the bass keyboard rather than pulling them down into the accordion. Once all the buttons are safely in your rack, you can remove the pipe retainers, usually including a flat brass or aluminum strap across each end of both sets of pipes (chord set and note set) and two bent wire retainers in between. The straps and wire retainers are anchored by small brass wood screws. Before removing the pipes or disturbing their order, take note of the logic of their arrangement. You will be removing and storing the pipes in order, but in case they get mixed up you want to be able to get them back into the proper order. There are two common arrangements for the chord pipes, one for accordions with their bass reeds laid out in the reed blocks in accordance with the chromatic scale (by far the most common) and one for those with their bass reeds mounted in accordance with the circle of fifths. In accordions with their bass reeds arranged in accordance with the chromatic scale, you will see that the chord pipes are arranged in order of the position of their cam lever along the pipe, which puts the pipes in the same order as the reeds. Usually, the pipe that opens the valve for the first reed in the reed block goes in first. It has its cam lever (which actually lifts the valve), at one end of the pipe. The pipe that opens the valve for the second reed in the reed block goes in second. It has its cam lever (which actually lifts the valve), a short distance from the end of the pipe. As you ascend the chromatic scale (and travel along the reed block and the associated row of bass valves), each successive chord pipe cam lever is located just a bit farther from the end of its pipe, because the valve it opens is just a bit farther down the line of valves. The last cam lever opens the last valve in the row. The cam levers line up like stair steps along the row of valves, the first cam lever opening the first valve, the second cam lever opening the second valve, and so on, with the last cam lever at the opposite end of the pipe opening the last valve. The note pipes might be arranged slightly differently. While still generally in chromatic scale order, part of the order may run up the scale and part of it may run down. For instance, in one I recently had apart (see the photo immediately above), the first five note pipes operated valves 1 through 5, then the sixth pipe jumped to valve 12 and from there the sequence continued backwards down through valve 6. In accordions with their bass reeds arranged in the reed blocks in accordance with the circle of fifths (i.e., in the same order as the bass buttons) the pipes are arranged differently, in the order required to put the notes back into chromatic scale order. In other words, the first pipe opens the first note of the chromatic scale, and the second pipe opens the second note in the scale, just as before, but the second note in the chromatic scale is not the second valve in the row. It is located farther along the row, and so its cam lever is located farther down the pipe. It is not nearly as easy to visually determine the proper order of the chord pipes in this arrangement, because the cam levers do not line up like stair steps. The important thing is to recognize and remember the proper order, or at least be sure you can figure it out logically, because there are about 479 million possible ways to put them back (the number of possible 12-permutations of 12 = 12! = approximately 479 million). If you put them back in random order, the odds are about 479 million to 1 against you getting the right order on the first try. If you try 1 permutation every 3 minutes, working 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, 50 weeks per year, you will try 40,000 permutations per year and it will take you 9,475 years (over 100 lifetimes) to try all the possible permutations. So before you take the pipes out, make sure you understand how they must go back in. Here is your disassembled bass machine: Getting the pipes out of order is not a problem with accordions with removable bass machines, because the entire bass machine, buttons and all, and sometimes even including the bass board, is fastened in with just a few screws or clips, sometimes as few as two. Remove these few screws or clips, lift out the bass machine as an assembly, and you have instant access to the bass valves. Once you have finished your work on the valves, you will have to reassemble the bass machine. If your work included re-valving, you will have to set up the bass machine as you assemble it. Setting up the bass machine involves setting the bellcrank actuating levers at the proper angle to engage the pegs on the sides of the pistons with a minimum of lash, but not zero. Instructions for setting up the bass machine can be found in the article on re-valving the bass side. Installing a new bellows New bellows are so costly that we rarely replace them unless we have to. But replacing them can help make your old accordion look and feel like new, and you can minimize the cost by doing it yourself. Just cut the old one off and glue the new one on. However, don't get in a hurry to cut the old bellows off just yet, because it takes two or three months to get a new one made and delivered. Measure the length, width, and depth of folds of your old one precisely in millimeters. Give the bellows maker those measurements along with the number of folds, the metal corner style number, and the colors you want for the leather corners, the bellows fabric, and the bellows tape. I get mine from Fernando Marconi in Castelfidardo. You have to reuse your old bellows frames because they were custom made to precisely fit your treble and bass cabinets. Once you have the new bellows in hand, use a box cutter to cut the old bellows off your old bellows frames, but not before marking each frame on its front side so you will be sure get them both installed in the proper orientation on the new bellows. Cut the cardboard as close to the wooden bellows frames as possible without damaging the wood. The hardest part of the job is scraping the remaining cardboard and glue off the bellows frames. You want to get down to the bare wood to ensure a flat mating surface and a strong glue joint between the old bellows frame and the new bellows. You can sometimes speed up this process by applying a bit of heat to the old glue. A heat gun is not advisable because you risk melting the plastic trim around the bellows frame, so I made a copper scraping tip for my 30 watt soldering iron ($5 from Orchard Supply Hardware). It is constructed very similarly to the copper waxing tip I made for my 15 watt soldering iron, except I used a heavier gauge of copper for the scraper. If heat does not soften your glue, you will have to scrape it off the hard way, with a box cutter and a lot of elbow grease. In that case, expect to spend two to three hours scraping. Once you have them clean, get them both oriented with their previously marked fronts pointing in the same direction, and make sure the bellows is going to be a good fit. Glue the new bellows onto the frames one at a time as follows. Paint Elmer's white wood glue onto the mating surface of one of the bellows frames with a small brush. Make sure you get a good even coat all over the mating surface, then add a small bead all the way around on top of that without brushing it out. You want just enough glue so that it slightly oozes out all around when you put the bellows on, but not so much that it runs out and makes a mess. With the bellows frame lying flat on your work table with the glue side up, set the new bellows down on it ensuring that you have it perfectly centered. Press it lightly down and with a damp rag wipe off any excess glue that appears from the joint. Place a 30 pound weight on top of the bellows (I use my test bellows, which has a heavy box of bolts inside, with an accordion on top of that), and let the glue dry for at least two hours, continuously cleaning off any excess glue, taking care not to wipe it into the bellows folds. After two hours, remove the weights, carefully turn the bellows over, and repeat the process for the second bellows frame, taking special care to get the marked front sides of both bellows frames pointed in the same direction. This time leave the weights on overnight. In the morning you will be able to install your new bellows and immediately start breaking it in. Re-valving the bass side and setting up the bass machine If you determine that your bass valves are leaking, check first to see if some foreign object might be lodged under any of the valves (see the article on finding leaks). Next, check to see if any of the bell crank (bass pipe) levers are resting tightly enough against their piston pegs to keep a valve from firmly closing. Often, these two steps will reveal the problem. However, it is not uncommon to find bass valves leaking due to deterioration of the felt or leather, due to poor alignment at the factory, or due to some kind of structural failure of the mounting of the pallet arms. The following photo, shows a failed glue joint, which allowed spring pressure to arch the hinge bar upward, putting three pallets out of parallel with the foundation plate and causing those three valves to leak. For leaks caused by valve misalignment or deterioration, you will have to remove the bass machine in order to gain access to the valves. Unless you have a removable bass machine (perhaps 5% of accordions have them), you will have to disassemble the bass machine piece by piece and remove the pipes one at a time. See the article on disassembling the bass machine for instructions and an important warning about keeping the pipes in order. Once your bass machine is totally out of the way, you can remove the pallets, but first close all the slides you can, and protect the slides and the remaining open ports with a small sheet of paper that you can move along as you twist each of the 24 pallets from its pallet arm. Catch as much of the crumbling wax debris as you can, in order to prevent it from falling into the slides or down into the reed blocks. When you have all the pallets out, set the accordion back upright (resting on the bass section) and shake out whatever debris you missed. At some point you should also remove the bass reed blocks and shake them out because some debris probably got into them. Strip the old valve facings off the pallets and scrape off the old glue. Measure the thickness of the old valve facings and procure some new valve facing of the same thickness (I get mine from FRM Enterprises in Massachusetts). Use your roller cutter to cut strips of valve facing one note pallet wide and do the same for the chord pallets. Then cut individual valve pads from the strips, 12 to fit your note pallets and 12 for your chord pallets. Glue the new valve pads/facings onto the pallets and set them aside to dry. Use a thin coat of glue to prevent any of it from soaking into and hardening the felt. Check all pallet arm hinge points and hardware for security and proper alignment, repairing any loose or misaligned mountings. Make sure all pallet arms rotate freely on their hinge points. Bend all pallet arms as necessary to exactly center them over their ports, taking care not to over-stress the pallet arm hinge points. In other words, support the pallet arm with one bending tool while you bend it with another. The goal here is to center the pallet over the ports, and since the pallet arm rests in the groove along the centerline of the pallet, centering the pallet arm is an essential step. This is your best chance to resurface the cams and cam followers to ensure smooth operation. Don\u2019t skip this step, because re-valving always results in slight changes in pallet height and thus in the height of the cam follower. This means the cam will strike the cam follower in a slightly different position and from a slightly different angle than it did before. Decades of use have created a unique wear pattern on the mating surfaces of each cam and its cam follower, and changing the pallet height alters the relationship that created this wear pattern so the surfaces no longer mate properly. This results in noisy operation and high friction that can cause valves to stick open. The remedy is to grind these worn mating surfaces smooth with fine emery cloth and polish them with crocus cloth. Check them with a magnifying glass under a bright light to verify that you have both surfaces smoothly polished. Polishing a cam Polishing a cam follower Once you have the cams and cam followers sanded smooth and brightly polished, set all pallets in position, trimming any corners as necessary to ensure clearance between the pallet and the surrounding structure. Use a pair of bending tools to bend the pallet arms as required to make them lie flat in their pallet grooves (avoid putting too much stress on the pallet arm hinges and mounts). Significant bending of these arms will be required if your new valve facings are not exactly the same height as the old. Remove the pallets to verify that all pallet arms are still centered over their ports, and correct any mis-alignments. Reinsert the pallets under the pallet arms, place the springs in position over the pallet arms, and verify that none of the note pallet arms are contacting the underside of any of the overlying chord pallet arms. During play, the note pallet arms will lift the chord pallet arms, but you want a small amount of clearance between them to ensure that the chord pallets will rest firmly closed until their corresponding note buttons are pushed. A few thousandths of an inch is all the clearance you need. If you can see the note pallet arm move at all before it contacts the underside of the chord pallet arm, or if you can hear a faint click as the rising note pallet arm contacts the underside of the chord pallet arm, you have enough clearance. With all adjustments made, it is now time to wax the pallets to their pallet arms. Use the modified soldering iron to apply enough heat to make the wax flow all around and under the pallet arm and down into the groove, but not so much that the wax flows down over the side of the pallet (see the article on waxing with a modified soldering iron). Press down evenly on the pallet to ensure that it lies flat on the foundation plate as the wax solidifies. When the wax and the pallet arms have cooled, check again to make certain that no note pallet arms are contacting the undersides of their overlying chord pallet arms. Bend the ends of the chord pallet arms up as required to obtain a few thousandths of an inch clearance. Also check for leaks before you reassemble the bass machine. One way to check for leaks is to place the accordion on your workbench accordion stand (see the article on disassembling the accordion for some tips on making a workbench accordion stand) and lift the bass section to expand the bellows. Let the bellows close under the weight of the bass section plus some moderate pressure from your hands and listen closely for leaks as the bellows closes. If you push down very hard, you can cause air pressure in the bellows to force the bass valves open on any accordion, but they should stay closed under a few pounds of pressure, such as in normal playing. Another way to check for leaks, working from the reed block side, is to remove the reed blocks and check each valve with a paper feeler gauge. If you don't feel significant and uniform friction all around the edges between the leather valve facing and your feeler gauge, the valve is not seating properly. Check very carefully for leaks, because this is your last chance to correct any problems before assembling the bass machine. Detecting a leaking valve later could cost you half a day's work to disassemble and reassemble the bass machine again in order to gain access to your leak. Don\u2019t be discouraged if you find some leaks. It is common for the wax to shrink as it cools, lifting one end or the other of the pallet. The remedy is simple. Use your modified soldering iron to melt the wax again, taking greater care this time to keep the pallet lying flat while the wax cools. As a final check before reassembling the bass machine, check for uniform pressure and friction under each end of each pallet with a paper feeler gauge. A strip of paper \u00bc inch wide by 4 inches long works well. Do not install any pipes until you are satisfied that all pallets sit flat and evenly firm against the foundation plate, and that there are no leaks. It is best to let the new valves rest on their seats under spring pressure at least overnight to allow most of the initial compression to occur prior to assembling and setting up the bass machine. Setting up the bass machine means adjusting the clearance between each of the pipe levers and the piston peg that drives it. No matter how carefully you have tried to match your new valve facing material to the original, it is bound to be of at least slightly different thickness. This means that even if the bass machine was perfectly adjusted before, it will be out of adjustment after installing the new valve facings. The initial compression of the felt or foam cushions will also alter the adjustment. When you are satisfied that the initial valve compression has occurred, that all pallets are lying flat and tight against the foundation plate, and that you have no leaks, reinstall the note pipes in proper order, making sure that the lifting cam on each one fits under the cam follower on the pallet arm. Check each one for smooth operation before installing any pistons. Install the note button/pistons one at a time, making sure at each piston that none of its pegs contact their bell crank levers when the lifting cam is touching the underside of the cam follower on the pallet arm, as this would eventually cause the corresponding note pallet to leak. Provide some clearance between the peg and the lever as follows. You can save time and minimize the amount of bending by first bending the lifting cam lever (the single short lever that contacts and lifts the cam follower on the pallet arm) on each pipe to provide minimal lash at the first lever you adjust on that pipe. Bending the lifting cam to put the first lever into proper position relative to the piston peg should put all the other levers on that pipe in pretty close adjustment also. For minor adjustments of subsequent levers on that same pipe, bend the lever rather than the lifting cam. Bending the lifting cam later would put all the previously adjusted levers on that pipe out of adjustment. You must maintain at least some minimal amount of lash (clearance) between each of the pegs on the side of the piston and the lever it will contact when that button is pushed. However, don't allow too much clearance, as this could cause the button to rest lower than the others and might cause some notes of a chord to sound later than others. Barely perceptible clearance is enough. A 50th of an inch (1/2 mm) is about the most you should allow. You control this clearance by slightly bending the lever while preventing the pipe from rotating. You can prevent the pipe from rotating by firmly holding two or three other levers on the same pipe. I use 4-inch long pieces of 1/8-inch o.d. steel tubing (automotive brake line) slipped down over the levers as bending tools. Pushing two or three levers in one direction while pushing one lever in the opposite direction should cause the one to bend, but sometimes one of the others bends, too, and if this is one you have already adjusted, it will now be out of adjustment. For this reason, you must check the clearance at each peg and lever a second time, after all levers are initially adjusted. A further complication stems from the fact that if one lever is too tight against a piston peg, it will hold the bell crank (pipe) in such a position to create clearance at all other levers on that pipe. When you go back and properly adjust the tight one a bit farther from its peg, it allows all the other levers on that pipe to rotate closer to their pegs. If that rotation exceeds the clearance at one of those pegs, that peg will now be too tight. When that one is eased, another may become too tight. You may have to chase these diminishing clearances back and forth along the pipe to make certain none of its levers are tight against their pegs. This is extremely important, because as the new valve facings compress slightly over time under spring pressure and the impact of repeated closings, the clearance in the linkage will be slightly diminished. If there is no clearance to begin with, the compressed valve will not seal, and you will have an external leak. Once all the note pistons are installed and their levers are adjusted, install the wooden cap strip onto the slotted guide. Warning: if any of the cap strip screw holes have stripped threads down inside the slotted wooden guide, do not force the next larger screw size into the hole, as this will probably crack the wood and bulge it into one of the slots, causing that bass button to stick. The best way to repair a stripped screw hole is to glue in a soft wood plug and tap new threads into that. The softer the wood, the smaller the risk of splitting the slotted guide when you thread the screw into it. You can help prevent splits by temporarily supporting the segment holding the screw. Wedge thin plastic strips alongside the pistons in the slots on each side of this segment while you drill your pilot hole and tap in the new screw. Or take those pistons out and fill the slots snugly with wood or plastic plugs. But don\u2019t force your plugs in too tightly, or that, too, might crack the slotted guide. Even with this support you must be very careful not to split the wood. If it splits despite your best efforts, you will have to glue and clamp it back together, then use a thin metal file to clean the affected slot as required to allow the piston to move smoothly through it. Once the note piston cap strip is securely in place, install the slotted wooden guide for the chord pistons and install just the major and minor chord pistons. Naturally, you must adjust the clearance between each of the piston pegs and its lever as you go. Once again, you can save time by bending the lifting cam on the pipe to set the proper clearance at the first lever on that pipe. That should put all subsequent levers on that pipe into pretty close adjustment so relatively little bending will be required on those subsequent levers. Once all the major and minor chord pistons are in, install the plastic separator strip in the slot in the button side of the slotted guide and secure it with the little plastic tabs glued over the slot (or with screws or nails if that is how it was initially secured). Take special care not to drop any of the plastic tabs, as they will fall down between and under the pistons and will be very difficult to retrieve. You won't want to leave them down there, either, as they could lodge under a valve and cause a leak. When the plastic separator is secured, install the seventh and diminished pistons, adjusting the levers for each as you go, then finally the wooden cap strip. It is a good idea to check for leaks at every stage; after the pallets are waxed in, after the pipes are installed, after the note pistons are installed, after all the major and minor chord pistons are in, and again at the end. This way, if you detect a leaking valve somewhere along the way, you will know that you caused it during the current assembly stage, making it far easier to find and correct the problem. With your bass machine reassembly and setup complete, it is time to reinstall the bass cover, making sure to guide the air release button through its hole as you go. Install the bass cover screws, re-secure the bass strap, and play yourself a congratulatory song. By properly setting up your bass machine, you have just completed one of the more challenging accordion repair tasks. For even more challenging accordion repair task, see the articles on \"Sorting out mixed up bass pipes\" and \"Sorting out mixed up bass buttons.\" Removable bass machines Whenever we must get access to the bass valves, we really appreciate having a removable bass machine, because it saves us the work of removing 120 bass buttons one at a time, their supporting structures piece by piece, and all 24 bass pipes one at a time, just to get at the valves. Instead, we just remove two to four screws, or sometimes just release two spring clips, and\u2026 voila! The bass machine slips right out and we have instant access to the valves. Here is a photo of one with just two brass clips holding the bass machine and bass plate in place. Here it is again with the clips released. Now the bass machine is slid partly out of the accordion. And it\u2019s that simple. We now have access to the valves. When finished working on the valves, just slide the bass machine back into position and snap the two clips in place. Now, that\u2019s the way to design an accordion. Sorting out mixed up bass pipes If you or a previous owner have disassembled the bass machine and got the pipes out of order, and if you do not know the proper order, you have a serious problem. Because there are so many different possibilities (12! = just over 479 million for the note pipes and another 479 million for the chord pipes), you can never hope to get it right through random trial and error. To have any hope of success, you must deduce their proper order, which may not always be possible. Start by sorting the note pipes separately from the chord pipes. This is simple because each note pipe has three or four short levers in addition to the cam lever, while each chord pipe has many more and much longer levers. Next, determine the order of the reeds in the bass reed blocks by sounding them and naming their notes. Label each valve (directly under each reed you identify) with the name of its note. If the reeds and valves are in chromatic scale order, then you can assume that the note pipes must be arranged basically in the order of the positions of their cam levers along the pipe. That is, the one with the cam lever nearest to one of the ends will go in first, under the shortest valve arm, the pipe with its cam lever second nearest to that same end will go in second, under a slightly longer valve arm, and so on. However, as described in the chapter on disassembling the bass machine, in some accordions there are some discontinuities in that order, and some sections may even be in reverse order. These discontinuities will become obvious when you come to a valve whose cam follower lever is not long enough to reach out over the cam lever on what you might expect to be the next pipe. At this point you will have to find another pipe whose cam lever is properly positioned to lift this cam follower. In fact, you may have to back out a few pipes to find the correct new starting place. This would be a good time to look for evidence of wear on the underside of the valve lifting arms, which if present will tell you where the cam levers formerly contacted them. Use a light and a small mirror to examine the undersides, and mark the location of the worn area on top of the arm with a pencil or a permanent marker. If you are lucky enough to find such wear, then your puzzle is solved. All you have to do is install each pipe in the position that will cause its cam lever to contact the underside of the valve arm at the old wear point. If the accordion is new enough that no wear is visible, then at this point you will be faced with some inevitable trial and error. However, you should always be focused on the big picture, looking for the right new pattern and the proper place to begin that pattern, rather than trying random pipes. The point is, there is definitely a pattern; the arrangement is never random. The notes will be sequential in chromatic scale order, either up or down, possibly with some discontinuities and possibly with some segments progressing up the scale and some progressing down the scale. Labeling each of your remaining pipes with the name of its note will help you recognize and continue patterns. Each of the twelve pipes (whether note pipes or chord pipes) has its one and only cam lever positioned along the pipe so it can only reach one valve lifting arm, and that valve lifting arm is on the valve for that pipe\u2019s note. Since you already have the valves labeled, matching the pipes with the valves is a simple matter. The only hard part is labeling them because they are so small. I use a piece of masking tape stuck to one of the pipe\u2019s levers like a flag. Once you recognize the pattern developing in the order of the pipes, it will be simple to select the next pipe to install, at least until you reach another discontinuity and must discover the new pattern for the remaining pipes. If you fail to discover the pattern, you will have no real hope of ever getting it back together properly. If the reeds are mounted in circle of fifths order, you can still assume that the pipes will be in some kind of chromatic scale order, but you will also know that they will not be in the order of the positions of their cam levers along the pipe, which makes it much more difficult to visually identify the pipe that belongs in any given location. As in the process for chromatically ordered reeds and valves, you will have to label each of the valves with the name of its note, then find the pipe that has its cam lever correctly positioned to open this valve, and label it, too. You still don\u2019t know which pipe goes in first, but figuring that out will be comparatively easy, as there are now only twelve possibilities. Start by comparing the lengths of the cam follower arms mounted on the bass valves. Obviously, they have to reach out over the assembled pipes far enough to reach the cam lever on the pipe for that note. A very short cam follower arm means the pipe containing the cam lever that will open that valve cannot be too far away. A very long cam follower lever indicates that its pipe is probably farther out. Unfortunately, there may be some ambiguity due to the fact that accordion manufacturers do not always trim off the cam followers at just the right length. Some are left a bit longer then they need to be. Note that some of the valves have their cam follower levers pointing the opposite direction, but the same principle still holds. The pipe must be close enough to that valve\u2019s cam follower to allow the cam lever on the pipe to contact and lift the com follower on the valve. This knowledge, combined with your knowledge of pipe order, should allow you to deduce which pipe goes in first. Or at least narrow it down to very few possibilities. After that, it is just a matter of following the chromatic scale, which is easy once you have each pipe labeled with the name of its note. Once you have the first pipe in its proper place, find the pipe for the next note in the chromatic scale, and install it in second place. Continue up (or down) through the chromatic scale, one pipe at a time. If you reach a point where this does not work because the cam follower does not reach the cam lever, then back up and try one of the other possible pipes in first position, and work up through the chromatic scale from there. When you have the correct pipe in the first position, and all the other pipes in chromatic scale sequence, all the cam followers will reach their cam levers. Naturally, you can also look for wear patterns on the bottoms of the cam followers to see where the cam has been rubbing on it, and position each pipe so its cam rubs at the same spot as it did before. As a final check, in the case of note pipes, install the note buttons and verify that each one properly reaches its pipe lever and that the proper valve opens when the button is pushed (for instance that the C valve opens when the C button is pushed). In the case of chord pipes, install the chord buttons and verify that the pegs on the side of each one contact the three or four levers that open the three or four valves required to make up the right chord for that button. For instance, verify that the three pegs on the side of the C major piston contact the levers that rotate the C, E, and G pipes and that the C, E, and G valves open when the C major button is pushed. Sorting out mixed up bass buttons Each of the bass buttons is unique and must go back in its original place for the bass machine to work properly, so they must be kept in the proper order to ensure that they go back where they belong. If they get mixed up, they will not fit properly and the bass machine will not operate properly. Although I have encountered and repaired some accordions that came to me with a few of the buttons inadvertently switched with others, and thus playing the wrong chords, I have never had to straighten out one that was completely jumbled. I cannot say for certain that it is possible, particularly with regard to the chord buttons, since the number of possible permutations is astronomical and only one of them will work. However, I have received inquiries from people who have suffered this misfortune, so I have prepared this advice, in case it ever happens to you. You may need to modify this procedure slightly to account for the diagonal orientation of each chord family row, but the basic principles should apply. Please note that this procedure is based on the assumption that your note pipes and chord pipes are already installed in the proper order. First note that all the longest pistons are note pistons and therefore belong in the two bottom rows of holes in the bass board (assuming a 120 bass accordion). Notice that each note piston has just one peg on the side of it that must engage a lever on one of the note pipes. Notice also that there is a slightly different distance from the button board to each note pipe, and a corresponding set of twelve different distances from the top of each button down to the peg on the side of its piston. Sort all the note pistons in order according to the distance from the top of the button down to the peg on the side of the piston. This should give you eight piles of three pistons and four piles of 4 pistons. Next, identify the note controlled by each note pipe and label the pipes with their note names. You can do this by sounding the reed that lies behind each valve and identifying the note by ear or with your electronic tuner. Hint: Identifying any two adjacent reeds will allow you to determine whether your bass reeds are laid out in accordance with the chromatic scale (most likely) or in accordance with the circle of fifths, (less likely), which will in turn allow you to extrapolate and label all the other reeds without actually sounding them. Now that you know the names of the notes played by each valve, you can easily determine which pipe opens any particular valve and therefore can assign the proper note name to each pipe. Knowing which pipe plays which note tells you which note is played by the pistons of any particular length, measured from the top of the button to the peg, because only the three or four pistons of the proper length will properly reach the three or four actuating levers on that pipe. In other words, the longest pistons play the note controlled by the most distant pipe, the shortest pistons play the note controlled by the closest pipe, and so on. This allows you to assign a note name to each pile of pistons. With each pile now labeled with its note name, use your knowledge of the bass button layout to determine which three or four holes in the bass button board match each pile of note pistons. Now sort each of your twelve piles of pistons into two sub-piles according to the angle of the offset bend between the flat part of the piston and the button. It is easy to do this by laying the piston on edge on the table and seeing which buttons are thereby lifted farthest off the table. These have the greatest offset angle in order to reach the fundamental bass row of holes, and therefore are your fundamental bass row pistons. The pistons with the smaller offset angle are your counter-bass row pistons.","title":"Accordion Repair 2"},{"location":"accordion-repair2/#renewing-treble-valves","text":"Renewing, refacing, re-valving; whatever you choose to call it, replacing the felt/leather facing on your treble valves will make your accordion use less air and will reduce the clattering of the keyboard. Old hard felt is less effective as a cushion, and compressed felt allows the key to travel farther and faster before closing. Both factors contribute to a noisy, clunky keyboard. Re-valving and re-levelling will go a long way toward making your keyboard look, feel, and work like new. Begin by removing the treble grille and treble switch assembly, and disassembling the keyboard. Unless your accordion has a tone chamber, you can technically re-valve without disassembling the keyboard, but by taking all the keys out you will be less likely to drop brittle wax debris into your treble register slides or into the reed blocks when you twist off the pallets. This is also your best chance to clean under the treble keys and to clean the spindles, as well as to install new felt stops under the keys, and/or adjust the depth of the keyboard action. See the article on setting up a treble keyboard for specific instructions. Next, measure the thickness of the felt and leather laminate on your treble pallets. Some accordions have different thicknesses on the white and black keys. If your accordion has a tone chamber, the valves in the chamber may have a different thickness facing from those outside the chamber. Technically, you can change these thicknesses, but doing so will significantly increase the amount of bending you will have to do on the key rods. This is particularly troublesome on keys in the black key row, which often have very short rods. If your accordion has just leather facing with no felt cushion behind it, you may choose to add some padding, but the easiest way is to match the original thicknesses. Once you have all the keys out, note how the pallets are fastened to the key rods. Your pallets will most likely be fastened to the rods with reed wax, which will break away fairly easily as you twist the pallet off the rod. However, some pallets have small plastic sleeves that slip over the ends of the key rods, which in most cases slip off and back on fairly easily. A few accordions have the pallets glued to the key rods, in which case this next step may not apply, which is to remove the pallets from the key rods. If they are fastened on with wax, you may be tempted to leave them on to save the work of re-waxing them, but you will probably dislodge some of them during the cleaning process anyway, and once off the rods the pallets are easier to handle, so you might as well take them off right at the beginning. The black key pallets are sometimes a different height, length, and/or width than the white key pallets. If so, keep them separate. Strip the old valve facings off your pallets and scrape off the old glue. Applying heat may help soften the glue, so you might try using the modified soldering iron described in the article on installing a new bellows. Check to make sure pallets are not arched. Place them flat side down on a flat table and try to push a .003\" metal feeler gage under the center and ends. If you find .003\" or more clearance under any part of a pallet, sand it flat. If it is too thin to sand flat, then either replace it or glue on another thin layer and sand that flat. Finish by sanding lightly to cross hatch the surface for better glue adhesion. You want a nice flat, clean surface to apply the new facing. Select the valve facing material of appropriate thickness for each class of pallet. The traditional Italian valve facing material from FRM Enterprises comes in sheets large enough to do a whole accordion for about $18. You will have to cut the sheet into strips of the proper width to fit your pallets. I use a wheel cutter (available in fabric stores for about $20), a metal ruler/straightedge, and the pallet itself to gauge the width of the strip. Once you have it cut into strips, use the wheel cutter and straight edge to cut off lengths to fit your pallets. Your pallets are most likely to be wood, but may also be plastic or metal. If you have metal pallets you may choose to use a thin coat of hot glue or fabric glue for better adhesion, but if you have wood or plastic, use Elmer's white glue. Lay your newly cut valve facings on your work table felt side up. With a small brush, paint an even, thin coat of glue onto the bottom of a pallet. You want thorough coverage, but you don't want to leave any excess glue that might soak into the felt and harden it. Be sure to get the right pallet matched to the right thickness valve facing, then center it carefully over one of your valve facings, press the glued pallet onto the felt, and leave it to dry. Repeat for each pallet. Before proceeding any further, be sure you fully understand the article on setting up a treble keyboard, including its specific instructions on how to set the depth of action and level the keyboard. This is your chance to get your keyboard set up exactly the way you want it. Once you have decided on the proper height for your black keys, install all the black keys (sans pallets) back into the keyboard (if your black and white keys are all on one spindle, you may be tempted to install the white keys also, but you will have an easier time if you don't). Place all the black key pallets into position, carefully centering them over their ports and lining all their front edges up against a straight edge, making sure they won't interfere with operation of the white key pallets. Use your keyboard leveling/bending tools to bend each key rod as required to center it in the groove in the top of its pallet and to cause the rod end to lie level and flat in that groove at the same time that the top of the black key is at the proper height and exactly level with all the others. When you have all the key rods properly adjusted, wax them into the pallets. For details, see the article on waxing with a modified soldering iron. Take special care not to let any molten wax run down the sides of the pallet far enough to foul the felt padding or leather valve facing. If this happens, you will have to replace that leather/felt valve facing (don't panic; it is easy to replace). Even though all pallets were lying flat on their ports when you waxed them in, shrinkage of the wax as it cools might lift one end of the pallet, so check all corners of each valve with a feeler gauge made from a thin piece of paper. Use your bending tools to rotate the pallet as necessary for a perfect seal all around, and to tweak the rod as necessary to center the pallet over its ports, and to get your black keys exactly level. Repeat these same procedures for the white keys, then check for any valves that leak under bellows pressure. Use your paper feeler gauge and your bending tools to diagnose and cure any such leaks, and for a final leveling of the keyboard. When all is well, reinstall the treble switch assembly and treble grille, and play yourself a congratulatory song.","title":"Renewing treble valves"},{"location":"accordion-repair2/#setting-up-a-treble-keyboard-for-shallow-action","text":"One of the nicest things you can do for yourself if you don't already have it, is to set up your keyboard for nice shallow action. Especially of you play fast or use glissandos in your music, you and those around you will appreciate what a nice shallow action does for your playing. By shallow, I mean somewhere between 3/16 and 1/8 inch, measured right at the end of the white keys. This is clearly a matter of personal preference, but I find anything over 3/16 inch a bit cumbersome, and anything less than 1/8 inch does not provide enough tactile feedback. Besides, some of the valves on your accordion may not open far enough to allow the bassoon reed to sound if you set the action too shallow. By the way, all the following is based on the assumption that your accordion does not have a tone chamber. If it does, the same basic considerations apply, but the job is much more complicated, difficult, and time consuming because each treble key has two valves mounted to it. One of the valves is in the normal position and easy to adjust, but the other is in the tone chamber, where it is difficult to reach and to see, and therefore much more difficult to adjust properly. The challenge is that both valves have to close simultaneously and seal perfectly at the same instant that the key arrives at the correct level with all the other keys. With some experience and the right tools this challenge is manageable, but the first keyboard you set up should probably not be on an accordion with a tone chamber. Since this article is directed primarily toward those who have not previously set up a keyboard, it is tailored to non- tone chamber accordions. To find the minimum practical white key travel for your accordion, remove the treble grille and identify all the white keys (if any) that have short key rods with their valves located in the black key row, nearest the keyboard. If you have a normal full size 41/120 accordion with 19\" keyboard, you probably will not find any. But if you have a ladies' size or intermediate size, or if you have an extended keyboard with more than 41 notes, you will very likely find that from 1 to 3 of your white keys have stubby little key rods. They are usually C keys or E keys. The problem is that due to their shorter lever arm these valves do not open as far as the other white key valves for the same amount of key deflection, and if you make the action too shallow, they may not open far enough to allow enough air to flow through the reeds behind them to properly sound the bassoon reed, which requires more air than the others. This is particularly troublesome if the bassoon reeds are located at the rearmost ports because the rear of the pallet, being closer to the fulcrum, does not lift as far off the ports. Some accordion designers eliminate this problem by using compound levers on some or all of these keys. They attach the valve to a long lever hinged at the forward side of the foundation plate. This lever is lifted near its center by the stubby key rod, thus doubling the lift on the valve. If your accordion has no white key valves in the black key row, or if it has compound levers on those notes, you can relax, because the lower practical limit of white key travel is lower than you would want it in any case. But if you find one or more without compound levers, choose the lowest of those notes to test. With the Master switch on, and with light bellows pressure, play that note normally and measure the depth of the key deflection required to make all the reeds on that note respond satisfactorily. This is the minimum practical key travel for this key, and unless you want to make the stop under this key lower than all the other key stops (not recommended), it is the minimum practical travel for all of your white keys. Next, decide how shallow you want your key action to be. As long as that measurement is greater than your practical minimum, you have no worries. If it is less than your practical minimum, you will either have to compromise or redesign your accordion to have compound levers. Whichever course you choose, the white key travel you select is the basis for the rest of your work on this project. There are two ways to limit the key travel to your chosen value. You can limit how far up the keys can travel, and you can limit how far down they can travel. You will probably do a little of both. Upward travel is adjusted by bending the key rod. When the valve is closed, the key is just so high, and cannot go higher without bending the rod. (see the article on bending key rods and making bending tools). You will bend the key rods to set the key height exactly where you want it, usually flush with the ends of the keyboard cabinet. This usually looks the best, and is also very convenient, because you can simply place a long straightedge across all the keys, resting directly on top of the cabinet at each end and bend the key rods until all the keys just barely touch the straightedge and are not deflected by the straightedge when you press the straightedge down onto the ends of the cabinet. Any resulting movement is very easy to see, so this method allows very precise keyboard leveling. Make your initial bends as close as possible to the keys, and as far as possible from the pallets. If significant bending is required, you will find that one end or the other of the pallet has lifted off the foundation plate, which, if uncorrected, will cause the valve to leak. Make your second bend to correct this as close to the pallet as possible. Naturally, this second bend will impact the level of your key, so you will have to make another bend as close to the key as possible to correct that. You may go back and forth several times before you finally get it right. The point to remember is that bends made to raise or lower the key should be made close to the key, and bends to rock the pallet into parallel with the foundation plate should be made close to the pallet. Check all corners of each pallet with a feeler gauge cut from thin paper. For a perfect seal, you want to feel equal drag on the paper as you pull it out from under each corner. Once you have leveled your keyboard (set the upward limit of white key travel and got every valve sealing perfectly), the next step is to take out all the treble keys (see the article on disassembling the treble keyboard). Also remove the long felt strip (key cushion/key stop), which you will find glued to the cabinet under the ends of the white key bodies, and the short felt or leather key cushions/stops glued to the cabinet at the end of each black key slot. Scrape off any old glue and felt residue. As you have surmised by now, the downward travel is limited by felt stops (cushions) placed under the keys (green in the photo below). The stops are under the key body, not under the keytop overhangs at the ends of the white keys. Putting stops under the white keytop overhangs is a sure fire recipe for broken or delaminated keytops. If you have a wooden keyboard like the one above, you will notice that the keyboard cabinet slots for the black keys are shorter than the slots for the white keys. Assuming you made sure your keys were numbered as you took them out, by counting short slots and long slots up from the bottom of the keyboard you can easily determine which keys go where. If your keyboard is aluminum, the slots may all look the same, in which case you will have to count more carefully, especially if your white and black keys have separate numbering systems. Install a white key and an immediately adjacent black key in their proper positions near the center of the keyboard. You are choosing the approximate middle in order to be able to see and measure under the keys, and to be able to test various thicknesses of key stop material without taking the keys out each time. You are placing a black key immediately adjacent to a white key to allow setting the black key upward travel limit at the point where the top of the black key is exactly parallel to the top of the white key when they are both at their upward travel limits. When you have properly adjusted that black key's upward limit, measure the difference in height between the white and black keys at rest against their upward stops (i.e., with both of their valves closed). Fabricate two wooden shims exactly this height by about 1/2 inch wide and 2 inches long. You will eventually tape these shims onto the cabinet ends in line with the ends of the black keys, so the straightedge can be rested on these shims while you level the black keys. The next steps are to select the right combination of materials to use as white key stops to limit their downward travel to exactly the distance you selected early on, and to select the correct materials to use as black key stops to prevent the black keys from submerging below the level of the white keys when the white keys are at rest at their upward limit (you don't want excessive black key travel to cause you to inadvertently depress a white key while playing). The single white key and black key you have installed are your test beds for selecting the right material thicknesses. If the clearance under your single white key (measured at the future key stop location) is not more than 1/8 inch in excess of your chosen key travel dimension, you can use felt of the correct thickness to stop your key where you want it to stop. However, it may not be wise to use felt thicker than 1/8 inch, because it will compress too much, giving the keyboard a mushy feel. In case the clearance under your white key is more than 1/8 inch in excess of your chosen key travel distance, you will need to fabricate a long wooden shim of the correct thickness and width to be glued and clamped in place under the 1/8\" felt white key stop. Select your black key stop material in the same way, and cut individual pieces to glue into place, using one of the old stops as a pattern. These are in a much more difficult place to clamp, so if your shims (if any) are not too thick, consider making them of scrap leather and gluing them to the wood with fabric glue, which sets much more quickly. If you make your new black key stops wider or longer than the originals, take care that they will not interfere with the operation of the black keys or the adjacent white keys. Try your various shims and cushion (key stop) materials under your test keys before gluing anything in place. Once you are happy with your selection, remove your test keys and glue and clamp the long wooden shim in place (if you are using one) using Elmer's wood glue or equal, and glue your black key shims (if any) in place with the glue of your choice. When the glue has dried, glue your chosen felt key cushions/stops on top of the shims, using a very light coat of Elmer's, wood glue so as not to allow excess glue to soak into the felt and harden it. If you are also changing the felt trim under the white key overhangs, now is the time to do it. Now you are ready. Install the black keys first and use your bending tools to level them (with the wooden shims taped in place under the ends of the straightedge, naturally). As with the white keys, bends made to raise or lower the key should be made close to the key, and bends to rock the pallet into parallel with the foundation plate should be made close to the pallet. This is particularly challenging on black keys with short key rods, but avoid the temptation to hold the key and bend the rod. If you have an old style wooden key with the key rod driven into it like a nail, this could tear the rod out of the key, or loosen it, which opens an entirely new can of worms. If you have aluminum key rods that extend all the way through the key, you may overstress the key hinge. Stick to the standard procedure, which is to grip the rod with two bending tools, one on either side of the point where you want it to bend. If this standard procedure is clearly not working, then the nuclear solution is to twist the pallet off the key rod, clean all the old wax out of the pallet and revalve it, as the old valve facing is likely to have a waffle pattern impressed into it by the ports under it, and you will probably not be able to get it precisely back into position to seal properly (see the article on renewing treble valves). With the pallet off, use pliers on the end of the key rod to bend it into the proper position to lie flat in the slot on top of the re-valved pallet when the key is level. When you have it right, center the pallet over its ports, align it with neighboring pallets, and wax the key rod back into the pallet. Once you have your black keys level and sealing perfectly, reinstall the white keys, which were previously leveled. Play the accordion to check for leaks. If any leaks are felt or heard, first try high inward bellows pressure with the Master switch on to see if enough air is leaking to sound a reed, in which case you can identify the note by ear. Be aware that you will be hearing the piccolo reed, so the leak may be an octave or two farther down the keyboard (pitch-wise) than you initially think. With the grille still off, you should be able to identify the leaking pallet by pressing down on it to see if that temporarily stops the leak. When you have identified it, adjust it to seal properly using the procedures above. If you cannot readily identify the leaking note by pitch, set the accordion on its feet and use the bellows leak down procedure described in the article on finding leaks. When you finally have eliminated all leaks, put the grille back on and use your nice shallow keyboard action to play your favorite song.","title":"Setting up a treble keyboard for shallow action"},{"location":"accordion-repair2/#waxing-with-a-modified-soldering-iron","text":"When you need to wax but the job is too small to justify firing up your wax pot, use a modified 15 watt soldering iron. Bigger irons produce too much heat and will cause your wax to smoke, driving off volatile compounds and causing premature aging and embrittlement of the wax. Even a 15 watt iron produces too much heat unless you modify the tip to dissipate it. Make a heat sink/waxing tip from a piece of copper flashing and rivet it to your soldering tip. Longer soldering tips are better because they allow more secure mounting of the heat sink. The heat sink should be approximately 3/4 inch wide by 1 1/4 inch long. Remove the insulation from a short piece of solid (not stranded) copper electrical wire and cut it into two short lengths to use as rivets. Before removing the soldering tip from the iron, file one side of the last 3/4 inch of it flat to provide more bearing surface for the heat sink. Then drill two holes in it the same diameter as the wire, with the holes centered on the flat surface and 1/2 inch apart. Hold the copper heat sink firmly against the flat side of the soldering tip and use the holes in the soldering tip as a template to drill matching holes along the longest centerline of the heat sink. Clean off all burrs, then place the heat sink back on the flat side of the soldering tip, align the holes, and install the rivets. Trim the rivets so they protrude about one wire diameter beyond the assembled waxing tip on each side. Hold the heat sink and soldering tip firmly together while you set the rivets with a few light taps of a hammer on an anvil. The rivets should flare to about 1.5 times their original diameter. Reinstall the finished tip into the soldering iron, and you are ready to go. For this kind of waxing you need to have your wax formed into rods about the diameter of a pencil so you can melt the wax against the waxing tip and feed it into the work as it melts. Line a wide, shallow flat bottomed container with waxed paper. Pour hot wax into the container to a depth of about 1/4 inch. After it cools, cut it into strips about 1/4 inch wide and peel them off the waxed paper. Alternatively, you can set your block of reed wax in the sun to warm it to near body temperature, then cut off pieces to roll between your palms until they are the size and shape you want. You can use this waxing iron to deliver molten wax to precisely where you want it. Just plug in the iron a few minutes ahead of time so it can come to operating temperature before you begin. Place the hot waxing tip into the area requiring wax and feed the end of a wax rod into the tip, just as you would feed solder or welding rod into a soldered or welded joint. This works very well for sealing air leaks, for waxing pallets to key rods, and for waxing in a few reed plates. You can even wax an entire reed block this way, but the work goes faster with a wax pot and waxing spoon. That operation is described in another article.","title":"Waxing with a modified soldering iron"},{"location":"accordion-repair2/#adjusting-key-tension","text":"While you have your keys out is an excellent time to adjust your key tension, especially if high or uneven key pressures are making your accordion hard to play. Key tension is adjusted by bending the key springs. Grip the free leg of the spring as close to the coil as possible (but not through the coil) with needle-nose pliers and bend that leg with your fingers. Bend it toward the fixed leg to reduce the required key pressure; bend it away to increase the pressure. With the key below, changing the spring angle from about 90 degrees to about 45 degrees reduced the key pressure from 5 ounces to 2 1/2 ounces. I have seen accordions requiring as much as 5 or 6 ounces to depress a key (very hard to play), but I prefer key pressures in the neighbourhood of 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 ounces. I try to set the key springs to allow the key to start moving at about 2 1/2 ounces of pressure and to be fully open at about 3 1/2 ounces. Don't be tempted to reduce the pressure much below that, because weaker springs don't seal the valves as well and don't return the keys as quickly. You can easily make a simple scale to measure key pressure. I used a weak coil spring that I made by winding .025\" diameter stainless steel wire tightly around a 5/16\" bolt. I used some recycled plastic parts to make my scale plunger and housing, but you can just as easily make yours from wood or metal. As the left end of the plunger presses on the key, the spring tends to resist the travel of the plunger through the housing. As the coil spring compresses, the length of the plunger emerging through the top of the housing is directly proportional to the pressure on the plunger. Lines marked around the perimeter of the plunger indicate how far the plunger has traveled relative to the housing, and thus how many ounces of pressure you are putting on the key. You can use a postage scale to calibrate your scale in ounces, or you can calibrate it using the keys of an accordion whose key pressure you like, simply by marking a line on your plunger at the point where spring pressure of your scale begins to open those keys. I wrapped a gummed paper label around my plastic plunger, and marked my 2, 3, 4, and 5 ounce lines on that. My green housing is a plastic drive gear from an old fax paper roll, but you can use anything handy. Just drill a hole through it large enough for your plunger to pass with very little friction. A washer to retain the bottom of the spring, and a couple of wire pins installed through holes drilled through the plastic plunger complete the design.","title":"Adjusting key tension"},{"location":"accordion-repair2/#waxing-with-a-wax-pot-and-spoon","text":"In the accordion factories in Castelfidardo, they still wax reeds into the reed blocks with a wax pot and spoon. Prior to visiting there, I found it difficult to wax with a spoon, and preferred to use an eye dropper. However, the eye dropper is not without its problems, most notably the frequency with which it clogs up with wax that cools within it. I was therefore quite happy to observe and learn how to properly use the spoon. Properly used, it is a fast and convenient way to wax reeds into their reed blocks. Think of the spoon as a fountain pen. The flat sides of the spoon are its reservoir, and the forward point is the pen point. Heat the spoon in the wax pot until it matches the temperature of the wax. This takes only a few seconds. Withdraw the spoon, shake off some of the excess wax with one quick, light shake, and immediately rotate it to the horizontal. In this position the wax adheres to the sides of the spoon. As you rotate the rounded edge up toward the vertical, the molten wax flows toward the straight edge on the bottom. As you tip the point downward, the wax flows along the straight edge toward the pen point. By coordinating this rotation and tipping you can precisely control the rate at which wax runs off the point. Use this \"fountain pen\" to \"write\" the wax onto the work. To stop the flow, simultaneously tip the point back up to level and rotate the spoon back to horizontal. When it runs out of wax, dip it into the wax pot again. The people in the factories wax very quickly by rotating the reed block around in one hand to cause the molten wax to flow along the channels between adjacent reeds. This allows them to use the spoon at near maximum capacity. I have not yet developed this coordination skill, so I hold the reed block level and still, while I move the spoon along the channels, frequently rotating it around to deliver the wax at a slower rate. Even so, this is much faster than using the soldering iron with the modified waxing tip (see the article on waxing with a modified soldering iron). For a wax pot I use a small (1 quart) electric \"crock pot\" slow cooker. I use the high heat setting initially to melt the wax, then turn it down to low. If left on high, my pot will overheat the wax, causing it to smoke as the more volatile compounds are driven off by the excess heat. If allowed to continue, this smoking would cause premature aging and embrittlement of the wax. The best temperature for the wax is around 220 degrees Fahrenheit. At this temperature it is thin enough to flow freely, yet not hot enough to smoke. It is also hot enough to burn you pretty badly if you spill it on yourself, so be careful. And always keep in mind that wax is flammable. Keep open flames away from your wax pot. I buy my reed wax already mixed in one pound bricks from Frank Romano of FRM Enterprises in Montreal for about $19 per pound. I think Frank currently has a $300 minimum order, so check his online catalog for other things you might need (he is a good source for high quality reasonably priced shoulder straps, bass straps, felt/leather valve facing material, and just about anything else you might need to repair your accordion). You can also mix your own reed wax. There are various formulas in use, but all are mostly beeswax, with varying percentages of pine resin and a small amount of linseed oil. I have no experience mixing my own, and therefore cannot advise you on the exact proportions to use.","title":"Waxing with a wax pot and spoon"},{"location":"accordion-repair2/#making-an-over-size-air-release-valve","text":"After playing a Giulietti or a Petosa with their relatively large air release valves which allow closing the bellows quickly and easily with a minimum of whooshing noise, I always felt rather let down to have to go back to a normal accordion with its pathetically small, slow, and noisy air valve. When I push that air release button I want instant results. So I enlarged the air release valves on all my favorite accordions. Now I can close my bellows quickly and quietly. Open the accordion at the bass side, take out the bass reed blocks and set the bass cabinet bellows-side-down on the work bench. Remove the bass cover and locate your air release valve, button, and linkage. Examine both sides of the bass foundation plate right around the valve port, note any obstacles (reed block mountings, register slide linkages, bass strap adjustment screw, etc., and decide whether there is room to enlarge the valve, how much, and in which directions. Take into account the need for the linkage arm to reach across the center of the new larger pallet, and for the pallet to lift off its port when you push the air release button. Scavenge a bass pallet from a junk accordion, strip off the old valve facing, wax, and glue, and reface it with new felt/leather laminate. See the article on re-valving for more specific instructions. Remove the old air release valve by twisting it off its linkage arm. Place your new valve over the hole in the position you want it to occupy, re-bend the linkage arm as required to fit, including a vertical jog if the new pallet is taller than the original, and trace the valve perimeter with a pencil. Take out the new valve and its linkage and mark the perimeter of the enlarged hole you want to make, keeping it a minimum of 1/8 inch inside the previous tracing, so your new valve will have at least 1/8inch bearing/sealing surface all around the new hole. Use a round file such as a chainsaw file to enlarge the old hole out to your latest markings. Clean up all the sawdust, place the new valve into position, centered within its previously traced outline. Reinstall the linkage, check the height of the air release button, and bend the linkage arm as required to set the button at the correct height relative to the bass cover. Use your modified soldering iron to wax the pallet to its linkage arm (see the article on waxing with a modified soldering iron for more details). Reinstall the bass cover, reinstall the bass reed blocks, reattach the bass cabinet to the rest of the accordion, and test the operation of your new air release valve. The basics of this procedure can be used to add an air release button to an accordion that does not have one. In this case, you can either scavenge the linkage and button from a junk accordion and modify it to fit, or you can fabricate a new linkage assembly from scratch. If you fabricate from scratch, see the article on replacing bass buttons for tips on how to install the button onto your new linkage.","title":"Making an over-size air release valve"},{"location":"accordion-repair2/#installing-rhinestones-on-bass-buttons","text":"Most accordions came from the factory with a dimple on the C button, but many of us also like some tactile identification of the Ab and E buttons. It is fairly easy to add rhinestones to these buttons. It is even easier to just dimple them, but I think it is useful to have a unique tactile cue on the C, so I generally use rhinestones on the other two. To install a rhinestone you must first dimple the button by drilling a conical hole in the top of it, then glue a conical glass rhinestone into the hole, so if you want dimples, you just omit the rhinestones. Whatever the final goal, the drill tends to push the button down, so if the button is still mounted in the accordion, you need some way to hold the button up while you drill. I use a hemostat that I have modified to have a circular gripping surface to minimize damage to the sides of the button. I put the hemostat loosely in place, forcing some neighboring buttons down flush so the hemostat can lie flat on the bass board and grip the Ab or E button near the bottom. Then I clamp the hemostat in place to keep the gripped button from depressing. On accordions it is always best to drill by hand. For most drilling I use a drill chuck taken from an old drill motor to grip the drill bit and I turn it by hand. For drilling bass buttons I have a modified (sharpened to 45 degree angle, rather than the standard 30 degree) 5/32\" drill bit mounted rigidly in a brass knob, with a close fitting rigid plastic tube around the drill bit to act as a stop, allowing the drill to penetrate only to the depth of the conical back of the rhinestone. If you drill too deeply, the rhinestone might not stick up far enough to be noticed. The short piece of thin walled brass tubing fits over both the button and the plastic tube to keep the drill bit centered on the button. Alternatively, I sometimes drill a small pilot hole in the center of the button, then enlarge the hole with the 5/32\" drill bit. In this case the pilot hole keeps the drill centered. Of course, all this is even easier if you have the piston out of the accordion, and it is not too hard to get them out, if you are so inclined. Just remove the note piston cap strip, as in the photo below, lift the desired piston out of its slot and fish it out through the top of the bass keyboard. It will take a little patience to get it back in and properly engaged with its bell crank lever, but the ease of drilling your button in a bench vise makes it worthwhile. When I have drilled to the desired depth, I put a small drop of Superglue into the hole and set the rhinestone in place. In just a minute or two it sets and the accordion is ready to play. To minimize the chances of gluing your fingers together, it is a good idea to wear latex gloves when working with Superglue. I handle the rhinestones by sticking a small screwdriver to the top of the rhinestone with a bit of reed wax, leaving the conical bottom clean for best adhesion. I use a wooden toothpick to press the rhinestone down and free it from the screwdriver, then to clean up any excess superglue that oozes out from under the rhinestone before it dries. I use 4.0-4.1mm Swarovski crystal rhinestones from Fire Mountain Gems. You can order online at firemountaingems.com. Order stock number H20-4835CY for clear, order stock number H20-4843CY for emerald. Other colors are available. They cost a little over a dollar for each package of 12, but the shipping on my last order was $7.65, so to minimize your average cost get lots of them. Use a 5/32\u201d (4mm) drill bit (sharpened to 45 degrees) with a stop set to allow you to drill only as deep as the tapered point. This gives the correct angle and depth of hole to fit the conical back of the rhinestones. Here is a nice clean installation.","title":"Installing rhinestones on bass buttons"},{"location":"accordion-repair2/#replacing-bellows-tape","text":"Bellows tape serves to strengthen the bellows folds, protect the cardboard from abrasion, and enhance the appearance of the accordion. Keeping the bellows tape in good shape can prolong the life of the bellows. It is normally stuck to the underlying bellows fabric with a glue that allows it to be peeled off without damaging that fabric, so when your bellows tape becomes tattered and frayed, you can peel it off and replace it without destroying the bellows. Replacing bellows tape is time consuming and therefore expensive if you have someone else do it, but it is not difficult to do yourself. Bellows tape is available in 19mm wide x 50 meter rolls in a variety of colors from Frank Romano of FRM Enterprises in Montreal, for about $36 per roll. I think FRM requires a minimum order of $300, so you will have to combine your tape order with some other items to make it economical, or find another source. The first step is to prop the bellows open. Pull all the bellows pins (keeping them in order) and separate the bellows from the treble and bass cabinets, marking it as necessary to allow you to reassemble it in the correct orientation later. Cut two pieces of 1/8 inch plywood or masonite particle board about 3 inches wide x about 1/2 inch less than the outside width of your bellows. These should be made to fit snugly into the interior folds of your bellows, one at each end so they can be used to hold the bellows open while you work. Drill a 1/2 inch diameter hole at the exact center of each piece. Cut a piece of 1x1 wood molding about 14 inches long and make a tapered point on each end, to fit into the holes. Insert the plates into the last fold at each end of the bellows, stretch the bellows open, and insert the pointed rod into both holes. This should hold the bellows open while you work. The second step is to remove all the old tape and glue. Slip a dull blade under the corners at each end of a tape to allow you to grasp the tape with your fingers and peel it off. Smooth the underlying surface as well as you can without damaging the underlying fabric, because any irregularities or lumps you leave will telegraph through the new tape. Choose one side of the bellows to do on the first day. If you are not yet good at this, it might be wise to start with the back. Mark all the metal corners with a pen or with a straight row of short pieces of masking tape so you can keep the ends of your tape well aligned and flush with those markings. Cut your new bellows tapes to the right length to fit the folds on the bellows side you have chosen. Fold each tape in half the short way and put a firm crease down the middle of it to help keep it centered along the bellows fold. Lay five or six of the tapes out upside-down on a sheet of masking paper or newspaper and apply the glue to the tapes with a small brush. Use the special bellows tape glue from FRM Enterprises, which is designed to release, making your bellows repairable in the future. If you use Elmer's or something similar, the next time someone needs to change a metal corner or repair your tape, they will not be able to do it without damaging the bellows fabric and perhaps even the cardboard, and that will be the end of the bellows. Using the creases as your guide, center the first tape on a bellows fold with both ends aligned with your markings on the metal corners and press it firmly into place, using a damp cloth between your fingers and the tape. The tape will tend to flex back open until the glue begins to set, so you may have to repeat this a few times until it finally holds. When you have the first five or six tapes installed in this manner, run the damp cloth over them all once more to wipe away any excess glue, and repeat the process with five or six more tapes. When you have all the tapes installed and all the excess glue cleaned off, remove your interior props, close the bellows, and place a 30 pound weight on it (another accordion in its hard case works well), and let the glue cure overnight. The next day repeat this process for the next side and so on until you have all four sides done. You will notice that the end folds are a special case. These folds (like all the rest) were taped before the bellows was glued to the bellows frame, so nearly half the tape is stuck in the glued joint and will have to remain there. You cannot pry this joint apart without destroying the bellows. The best you can do is to cut these tapes a bit narrower and tuck one edge of the tape as far down into the glued joint as you can without damaging the joint. Alternatively, if the tape on these folds is not damaged and if you are re-taping with the same color tape, you might consider leaving the end folds alone. If you want to put a design into your bellows tape with a contrasting color, install the design first, using short tape segments, then cut your regular tape to length to fit all around it (butting up to it) and install that last. Do not install the design on top of your regular tape, as this double taping will thicken your bellows so your bellows straps will no longer close. New bellows tape can be applied over old bellows tape, and wider than normal tape (24mm wide) is made for this purpose. However, if you take this shortcut you will have to move your bellows straps and/or snaps, or replace them with longer straps. In that case, you will have some old screw holes to fill, including repair of the celluloid finish. For suggestions on how to do that repair, see the article on repairing stripped out screws.","title":"Replacing bellows tape"},{"location":"accordion-repair2/#replacing-bass-buttons","text":"It is not unusual to have to replace a bass button or two. Some prior owner may have butchered the button trying to mark it in some way. I have seen them with notches sawn into them apparently with a hacksaw, creases melted into the top apparently with a hot knife, and even with one side melted away where some misguided soul apparently touched it with a hot soldering iron. I have seen oversize jewels glued on top, and huge dimples drilled into the wrong buttons. I have also seen several buttons scratched and scraped, apparently by sliding on concrete or asphalt. Whatever the problem is, it can usually be solved by replacing the button. If your buttons are black, finding a matching button will be fairly easy. Just make sure you get the correct diameter. The height is not so critical, as the depth of the piston insertion into the button can be varied to make up the difference. If your buttons are red, gold, or some other color, getting an exact match will be difficult. Cerini in Castelfidardo sells new buttons, and so does FRM Enterprises in Montreal, but color choices are limited. Look first to any junk accordion you or your local repairman might have lying around. Junk accordions should never be thrown away, as they are excellent sources of hard to find parts and materials, including bass buttons. Once you have your replacement buttons in hand, disassemble your bass machine to the extent required to extract the pistons with damaged buttons (see the article on disassembling and reassembling bass machines). Carefully measure the overall length of the piston/button assemblies so you will be able to push the new buttons onto the pistons just far enough to match this overall length for each piston. To remove the old button, hold the piston with the damaged button in the fingers of one hand and twist and pull the button off with the other hand. If it will not come off, clamp the piston into a bench vise, or into a vise-grip pliers, which in turn is to be clamped into the bench vise (taking care not to bend the piston or to damage any if the pins or dogs pressed or stamped into the side of it), and heat the side of the piston with a soldering iron until the plastic or glue begins to soften just enough to allow you to pull the button off. Once you have the old button off, measure the diameter of the end of the piston that must go into the new button. Drill or ream the pilot hole in the bottom of the new button to exactly this diameter if you intend to glue it, or to just a few thousandths of an inch smaller if you intend to weld it (that is, if you intend to heat the piston to the melting temperature of the plastic button and force it into the pilot hole in the button, so that as the melted plastic around the pilot hole cools, it will adhere to the piston). In either case, drill or ream your pilot hole to a depth 1/16 inch greater than that theoretically necessary to allow pushing the piston into the button far enough to make the new assembly exactly the same length as your pattern. This allows room for some small amount of plastic or glue that may be pushed to the bottom of the pilot hole by the advancing piston. Whether you choose to glue or weld, the next step is to install the button onto the piston, taking care to make the overall length exactly match your previous measurement. When the plastic cools, or the glue dries, as the case may be, reassemble your bass machine, taking special care to ensure that every button goes exactly back where it came from and that every pin or dog on each piston properly engages its bell-crank levers. Reinstall the bass reed blocks, the bass cover and the bass strap, and reinstall the assembled bass cabinet onto the bellows. Check the bass machine for proper operation to make sure no buttons are sticking and all chord buttons are playing all the correct notes.","title":"Replacing bass buttons"},{"location":"accordion-repair2/#disassembling-a-bass-machine","text":"For various reasons, you may have to remove or disassemble a bass machine. For instance, if one or more bass valves is leaking and you are unable to solve the problem working from the reed block side, then the bass machine will have to be totally removed to gain access to the bass valves. If your bass machine is not removable as a unit, then you will have to disassemble it piece by piece. Other problems that can require at least partial disassembly of the bass machine include a bass valve hanging open due either to sticking \"pipes\" (bass valve bellcranks), worn cam levers on the pipes, or worn valve lifters (cam followers) on the valves. You might also encounter a broken actuating lever on one of the pipes, cracked or broken wood mountings for the bass machine, or pistons bent too badly to straighten without removing them first. Whatever the reason for disassembling your bass machine, you must make sure that you will be able to put it back together correctly, as each of the (usually 120) bass button pistons and each of the (usually 24) pipes is unique, and must go back in its original position. The easiest way to do this is to make a rack to hold the bass button/pistons in their proper positions relative to one another as you take them out. I drilled seven rows of twenty holes in three pieces of plywood that I then stacked with spacers between, to provide a separate chamber for each button from any accordion up to 140 bass. An easier way, if you have a junk accordion, is to salvage and use the bass keyboard, which already has the 120 holes drilled in it. After you remove your bass strap and bass plate, your bass machine should look something like this. Before you begin the disassembly, take a few moments to observe how your bass machine is constructed and how it works. This will help you understand how to keep its various parts in order and how to put it back together. By observing and understanding, you will also learn some things about accordion design and how the bass machine is really a simple mechanical computer that assembles chords on command. After going through this little exercise, whenever you look at a bass machine you will see order and symmetry and an elegant design, rather than the chaos and unfathomable complexity that you may be seeing now. Take your time. Relax. Get in touch with yourself and your machine. It is a beautiful machine that makes beautiful music, and in a few moments you will understand how it does it. With the bass cover off, push any bass chord button and observe that the button is on the top end of a long piston which has three pegs or tabs along one side of it (some older accordions have four pegs or tabs on their seventh chord pistons). Observe that each peg contacts a lever and forces that lever to move with the piston. Observe that there are four neat rows of levers, all lined up with four neat rows of pegs on the pistons. Notice that the bottom end of the piston passes through a slot in a wooden guide, and that the bottom of the piston has a sharp 90 degree bend to prevent the piston from coming out of the slot when valve spring pressure forces the piston upward as you release the button. Rest the tip of a small screwdriver or similar tool against the bottom end of the piston (90 degree bend) and rest your finger on the button at the top end. Rock the piston gently up (toward the button end) and down and notice that there is a small amount of clearance between each peg and the lever it engages, and that you can therefore rock the piston up and down by some slight amount without causing any levers to move. Notice that each piston has four possible locations for pegs or tabs, that only three of them are used, and that the position not occupied by a peg varies from piston to piston. As you peer down into the bass machine, notice the other tiers of pistons nestled beneath the top tier. Also notice that every second piston (button) in the top tier passes through a hole in the diminished chord row of the bass keyboard, and that the ones in between pass through holes in the seventh chord row. Notice that in the second tier down, every second piston (button) passes through a hole in the minor chord row, and that the ones in between pass through holes in the major chord row. Notice that each piston has a slightly different bend in it in order to accommodate this arrangement. Looking farther down inside the bass machine, you can see a tier of longer pistons with its own slotted wooden guide, and you will notice that every second piston (button) in this tier passes through a hole in the fundamental bass row and the ones in between pass through holes in the counterbass row. As you press one of these fundamental bass or counterbass note buttons, you will observe that the single peg (or tab) on the side of its piston engages a single lever and causes it to move with the piston. Notice that the bottom end of that lever is fixed to one of 12 slender steel rods (technically bell cranks, but commonly called pipes) lying under the pistons, and that this pipe rotates when the lever moves. With a bright light illuminating the area directly under these pipes, observe that as the pipe rotates, one of the 12 note pallets lifts, opening a note valve, and as it opens it also lifts an adjacent chord valve pallet. Find the fundamental bass note button (not the counterbass button) that opens the valve at one end of the pipes (where it is easiest to see) and observe that the pipe has a short cam lever on it that lifts a cam follower on that note pallet arm, opening the note valve as the pipe rotates. Notice that the note pallet arm extends past the end of the pallet and engages the underside of a similar extension on the chord pallet arm, causing the chord valve to open whenever the note valve opens. Now press the major chord button next to that same fundamental bass button, and watch the chord valve open while the corresponding bass note valve stays closed. Do the same, one at a time, with the minor, seventh, and diminished buttons in that same diagonal row of buttons (chord family). Notice that in each case the first pipe rotates, forcing its cam lever to lift the chord pallet, thereby opening the chord valve, and realize that this chord valve is for the root note of all the chords in this chord family. Understand that this particular pipe and its cam lever, along with two of its levers that engage pegs on these four pistons, cause the bass machine to play the root note whenever you push one of these chord buttons. As you press each of these chord buttons a second time, use your bright light to observe which other two valves open, along the row of 12 chord valves. Understand that these other two valves are the other two notes that join the root note to make up each of these chords. Observe that each valve is operated by only one cam lever and pipe, but that each pipe has many levers on it, each extending upward to engage a peg on the side of a chord piston that uses that particular note. Focus on just one of these pipes for a moment. Push one of its levers downward (away from the bass buttons) and observe how many other levers move with it, and which pistons have pegs that engage these levers. Whenever any one of those particular chord buttons/pistons is pushed, one of the pegs on the side of its piston engages one of the levers on this pipe, causing this particular pipe to rotate and the valve it controls to open. The other two pegs on that piston each engage a lever protruding from one of the other two pipes whose notes comprise the chord played by that button. Notice that there are 12 chord valves and 12 chord pipes, and that there are also 12 note valves and 12 note pipes. The note pipes operate the valves that control the two lowest octaves in your bass reed set, while the chord pipes operate the valves that control the (usually two or three) higher octaves. Each pipe in each set of 12 pipes is dedicated to a single note of the 12 note chromatic scale. Chords are played by rotating three pipes simultaneously, thus opening three separate valves. The bass machine assembles chords for you by opening the three correct note valves whenever you press any single chord button. Just as the chord valves and note valves are arranged in your bass machine, so are the reeds arranged in your bass reed blocks, because directly behind each valve lie the reeds for that note. Therefore, if your chord valves line up with your note valves (on some Russian accordions they don't), then all the reeds for that note line up across the various reed blocks. In other words, if the first reed in one reed block is Bb, then the first reed in each of the other reed blocks is also Bb, although in another octave. You can use this knowledge to determine how the bass reeds are organized within each reed block. Some accordions have their bass reeds organized in chromatic scale order, while some have them arranged in accordance with the circle of fifths. You can easily determine which system you have by observing the operation of your bass machine. Press your C note button and observe which valve opens. Now press the F or the G button. If a valve right next to the C valve opens, your bass reeds are arranged in accordance with the circle of fifths. If you must press a B button a C# button to get this valve to open, then your bass reeds are arranged in chromatic scale order. Either way, by identifying which button operates the valve at each end of your 12-valve array, and therefore which note lies at each end of the row of valves, you can now fill in the names of all the notes in between. With this knowledge, you can see which three notes are being played by each chord button. This is academic, I know, but if you have gone this far, and used your knowledge of the bass machine to deduce the arrangement of your bass reeds and to determine which notes comprise each chord, then you are to be congratulated for being truly in touch with your machine. You can now safely disassemble your bass machine with confidence that you will be able to get it back together correctly, so let us begin. In order to get the pistons out, you must first remove the cap strip (usually wood) over the guide slots at the bottom of the pistons. It is usually held in place by four or five small brass wood screws. Removing this cap strip allows the diminished and seventh chord buttons to be lifted out of their slots. Pull the buttons down into their holes as you remove the pistons one by one and place them in your rack. However, the minor and major chord buttons cannot be removed until first removing a thin plastic barrier that rests in a slot in the button side of the slotted wooden guide. Sometimes this plastic separator is held in place by several short narrow strips of plastic glued across the outside of the slot. In other cases it is held in place by tiny nails or by friction alone. When you get all the chord buttons out, you will have to remove their slotted wooden guide, which is held in by two large wood screws, one at either end. Once this is out, you will have access to the note buttons, which are retained by their own separate cap strip, which also must be removed. In most accordions it is easier to take the note buttons out through the top of the bass keyboard rather than pulling them down into the accordion. Once all the buttons are safely in your rack, you can remove the pipe retainers, usually including a flat brass or aluminum strap across each end of both sets of pipes (chord set and note set) and two bent wire retainers in between. The straps and wire retainers are anchored by small brass wood screws. Before removing the pipes or disturbing their order, take note of the logic of their arrangement. You will be removing and storing the pipes in order, but in case they get mixed up you want to be able to get them back into the proper order. There are two common arrangements for the chord pipes, one for accordions with their bass reeds laid out in the reed blocks in accordance with the chromatic scale (by far the most common) and one for those with their bass reeds mounted in accordance with the circle of fifths. In accordions with their bass reeds arranged in accordance with the chromatic scale, you will see that the chord pipes are arranged in order of the position of their cam lever along the pipe, which puts the pipes in the same order as the reeds. Usually, the pipe that opens the valve for the first reed in the reed block goes in first. It has its cam lever (which actually lifts the valve), at one end of the pipe. The pipe that opens the valve for the second reed in the reed block goes in second. It has its cam lever (which actually lifts the valve), a short distance from the end of the pipe. As you ascend the chromatic scale (and travel along the reed block and the associated row of bass valves), each successive chord pipe cam lever is located just a bit farther from the end of its pipe, because the valve it opens is just a bit farther down the line of valves. The last cam lever opens the last valve in the row. The cam levers line up like stair steps along the row of valves, the first cam lever opening the first valve, the second cam lever opening the second valve, and so on, with the last cam lever at the opposite end of the pipe opening the last valve. The note pipes might be arranged slightly differently. While still generally in chromatic scale order, part of the order may run up the scale and part of it may run down. For instance, in one I recently had apart (see the photo immediately above), the first five note pipes operated valves 1 through 5, then the sixth pipe jumped to valve 12 and from there the sequence continued backwards down through valve 6. In accordions with their bass reeds arranged in the reed blocks in accordance with the circle of fifths (i.e., in the same order as the bass buttons) the pipes are arranged differently, in the order required to put the notes back into chromatic scale order. In other words, the first pipe opens the first note of the chromatic scale, and the second pipe opens the second note in the scale, just as before, but the second note in the chromatic scale is not the second valve in the row. It is located farther along the row, and so its cam lever is located farther down the pipe. It is not nearly as easy to visually determine the proper order of the chord pipes in this arrangement, because the cam levers do not line up like stair steps. The important thing is to recognize and remember the proper order, or at least be sure you can figure it out logically, because there are about 479 million possible ways to put them back (the number of possible 12-permutations of 12 = 12! = approximately 479 million). If you put them back in random order, the odds are about 479 million to 1 against you getting the right order on the first try. If you try 1 permutation every 3 minutes, working 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, 50 weeks per year, you will try 40,000 permutations per year and it will take you 9,475 years (over 100 lifetimes) to try all the possible permutations. So before you take the pipes out, make sure you understand how they must go back in. Here is your disassembled bass machine: Getting the pipes out of order is not a problem with accordions with removable bass machines, because the entire bass machine, buttons and all, and sometimes even including the bass board, is fastened in with just a few screws or clips, sometimes as few as two. Remove these few screws or clips, lift out the bass machine as an assembly, and you have instant access to the bass valves. Once you have finished your work on the valves, you will have to reassemble the bass machine. If your work included re-valving, you will have to set up the bass machine as you assemble it. Setting up the bass machine involves setting the bellcrank actuating levers at the proper angle to engage the pegs on the sides of the pistons with a minimum of lash, but not zero. Instructions for setting up the bass machine can be found in the article on re-valving the bass side.","title":"Disassembling a bass machine"},{"location":"accordion-repair2/#installing-a-new-bellows","text":"New bellows are so costly that we rarely replace them unless we have to. But replacing them can help make your old accordion look and feel like new, and you can minimize the cost by doing it yourself. Just cut the old one off and glue the new one on. However, don't get in a hurry to cut the old bellows off just yet, because it takes two or three months to get a new one made and delivered. Measure the length, width, and depth of folds of your old one precisely in millimeters. Give the bellows maker those measurements along with the number of folds, the metal corner style number, and the colors you want for the leather corners, the bellows fabric, and the bellows tape. I get mine from Fernando Marconi in Castelfidardo. You have to reuse your old bellows frames because they were custom made to precisely fit your treble and bass cabinets. Once you have the new bellows in hand, use a box cutter to cut the old bellows off your old bellows frames, but not before marking each frame on its front side so you will be sure get them both installed in the proper orientation on the new bellows. Cut the cardboard as close to the wooden bellows frames as possible without damaging the wood. The hardest part of the job is scraping the remaining cardboard and glue off the bellows frames. You want to get down to the bare wood to ensure a flat mating surface and a strong glue joint between the old bellows frame and the new bellows. You can sometimes speed up this process by applying a bit of heat to the old glue. A heat gun is not advisable because you risk melting the plastic trim around the bellows frame, so I made a copper scraping tip for my 30 watt soldering iron ($5 from Orchard Supply Hardware). It is constructed very similarly to the copper waxing tip I made for my 15 watt soldering iron, except I used a heavier gauge of copper for the scraper. If heat does not soften your glue, you will have to scrape it off the hard way, with a box cutter and a lot of elbow grease. In that case, expect to spend two to three hours scraping. Once you have them clean, get them both oriented with their previously marked fronts pointing in the same direction, and make sure the bellows is going to be a good fit. Glue the new bellows onto the frames one at a time as follows. Paint Elmer's white wood glue onto the mating surface of one of the bellows frames with a small brush. Make sure you get a good even coat all over the mating surface, then add a small bead all the way around on top of that without brushing it out. You want just enough glue so that it slightly oozes out all around when you put the bellows on, but not so much that it runs out and makes a mess. With the bellows frame lying flat on your work table with the glue side up, set the new bellows down on it ensuring that you have it perfectly centered. Press it lightly down and with a damp rag wipe off any excess glue that appears from the joint. Place a 30 pound weight on top of the bellows (I use my test bellows, which has a heavy box of bolts inside, with an accordion on top of that), and let the glue dry for at least two hours, continuously cleaning off any excess glue, taking care not to wipe it into the bellows folds. After two hours, remove the weights, carefully turn the bellows over, and repeat the process for the second bellows frame, taking special care to get the marked front sides of both bellows frames pointed in the same direction. This time leave the weights on overnight. In the morning you will be able to install your new bellows and immediately start breaking it in.","title":"Installing a new bellows"},{"location":"accordion-repair2/#re-valving-the-bass-side-and-setting-up-the-bass-machine","text":"If you determine that your bass valves are leaking, check first to see if some foreign object might be lodged under any of the valves (see the article on finding leaks). Next, check to see if any of the bell crank (bass pipe) levers are resting tightly enough against their piston pegs to keep a valve from firmly closing. Often, these two steps will reveal the problem. However, it is not uncommon to find bass valves leaking due to deterioration of the felt or leather, due to poor alignment at the factory, or due to some kind of structural failure of the mounting of the pallet arms. The following photo, shows a failed glue joint, which allowed spring pressure to arch the hinge bar upward, putting three pallets out of parallel with the foundation plate and causing those three valves to leak. For leaks caused by valve misalignment or deterioration, you will have to remove the bass machine in order to gain access to the valves. Unless you have a removable bass machine (perhaps 5% of accordions have them), you will have to disassemble the bass machine piece by piece and remove the pipes one at a time. See the article on disassembling the bass machine for instructions and an important warning about keeping the pipes in order. Once your bass machine is totally out of the way, you can remove the pallets, but first close all the slides you can, and protect the slides and the remaining open ports with a small sheet of paper that you can move along as you twist each of the 24 pallets from its pallet arm. Catch as much of the crumbling wax debris as you can, in order to prevent it from falling into the slides or down into the reed blocks. When you have all the pallets out, set the accordion back upright (resting on the bass section) and shake out whatever debris you missed. At some point you should also remove the bass reed blocks and shake them out because some debris probably got into them. Strip the old valve facings off the pallets and scrape off the old glue. Measure the thickness of the old valve facings and procure some new valve facing of the same thickness (I get mine from FRM Enterprises in Massachusetts). Use your roller cutter to cut strips of valve facing one note pallet wide and do the same for the chord pallets. Then cut individual valve pads from the strips, 12 to fit your note pallets and 12 for your chord pallets. Glue the new valve pads/facings onto the pallets and set them aside to dry. Use a thin coat of glue to prevent any of it from soaking into and hardening the felt. Check all pallet arm hinge points and hardware for security and proper alignment, repairing any loose or misaligned mountings. Make sure all pallet arms rotate freely on their hinge points. Bend all pallet arms as necessary to exactly center them over their ports, taking care not to over-stress the pallet arm hinge points. In other words, support the pallet arm with one bending tool while you bend it with another. The goal here is to center the pallet over the ports, and since the pallet arm rests in the groove along the centerline of the pallet, centering the pallet arm is an essential step. This is your best chance to resurface the cams and cam followers to ensure smooth operation. Don\u2019t skip this step, because re-valving always results in slight changes in pallet height and thus in the height of the cam follower. This means the cam will strike the cam follower in a slightly different position and from a slightly different angle than it did before. Decades of use have created a unique wear pattern on the mating surfaces of each cam and its cam follower, and changing the pallet height alters the relationship that created this wear pattern so the surfaces no longer mate properly. This results in noisy operation and high friction that can cause valves to stick open. The remedy is to grind these worn mating surfaces smooth with fine emery cloth and polish them with crocus cloth. Check them with a magnifying glass under a bright light to verify that you have both surfaces smoothly polished. Polishing a cam Polishing a cam follower Once you have the cams and cam followers sanded smooth and brightly polished, set all pallets in position, trimming any corners as necessary to ensure clearance between the pallet and the surrounding structure. Use a pair of bending tools to bend the pallet arms as required to make them lie flat in their pallet grooves (avoid putting too much stress on the pallet arm hinges and mounts). Significant bending of these arms will be required if your new valve facings are not exactly the same height as the old. Remove the pallets to verify that all pallet arms are still centered over their ports, and correct any mis-alignments. Reinsert the pallets under the pallet arms, place the springs in position over the pallet arms, and verify that none of the note pallet arms are contacting the underside of any of the overlying chord pallet arms. During play, the note pallet arms will lift the chord pallet arms, but you want a small amount of clearance between them to ensure that the chord pallets will rest firmly closed until their corresponding note buttons are pushed. A few thousandths of an inch is all the clearance you need. If you can see the note pallet arm move at all before it contacts the underside of the chord pallet arm, or if you can hear a faint click as the rising note pallet arm contacts the underside of the chord pallet arm, you have enough clearance. With all adjustments made, it is now time to wax the pallets to their pallet arms. Use the modified soldering iron to apply enough heat to make the wax flow all around and under the pallet arm and down into the groove, but not so much that the wax flows down over the side of the pallet (see the article on waxing with a modified soldering iron). Press down evenly on the pallet to ensure that it lies flat on the foundation plate as the wax solidifies. When the wax and the pallet arms have cooled, check again to make certain that no note pallet arms are contacting the undersides of their overlying chord pallet arms. Bend the ends of the chord pallet arms up as required to obtain a few thousandths of an inch clearance. Also check for leaks before you reassemble the bass machine. One way to check for leaks is to place the accordion on your workbench accordion stand (see the article on disassembling the accordion for some tips on making a workbench accordion stand) and lift the bass section to expand the bellows. Let the bellows close under the weight of the bass section plus some moderate pressure from your hands and listen closely for leaks as the bellows closes. If you push down very hard, you can cause air pressure in the bellows to force the bass valves open on any accordion, but they should stay closed under a few pounds of pressure, such as in normal playing. Another way to check for leaks, working from the reed block side, is to remove the reed blocks and check each valve with a paper feeler gauge. If you don't feel significant and uniform friction all around the edges between the leather valve facing and your feeler gauge, the valve is not seating properly. Check very carefully for leaks, because this is your last chance to correct any problems before assembling the bass machine. Detecting a leaking valve later could cost you half a day's work to disassemble and reassemble the bass machine again in order to gain access to your leak. Don\u2019t be discouraged if you find some leaks. It is common for the wax to shrink as it cools, lifting one end or the other of the pallet. The remedy is simple. Use your modified soldering iron to melt the wax again, taking greater care this time to keep the pallet lying flat while the wax cools. As a final check before reassembling the bass machine, check for uniform pressure and friction under each end of each pallet with a paper feeler gauge. A strip of paper \u00bc inch wide by 4 inches long works well. Do not install any pipes until you are satisfied that all pallets sit flat and evenly firm against the foundation plate, and that there are no leaks. It is best to let the new valves rest on their seats under spring pressure at least overnight to allow most of the initial compression to occur prior to assembling and setting up the bass machine. Setting up the bass machine means adjusting the clearance between each of the pipe levers and the piston peg that drives it. No matter how carefully you have tried to match your new valve facing material to the original, it is bound to be of at least slightly different thickness. This means that even if the bass machine was perfectly adjusted before, it will be out of adjustment after installing the new valve facings. The initial compression of the felt or foam cushions will also alter the adjustment. When you are satisfied that the initial valve compression has occurred, that all pallets are lying flat and tight against the foundation plate, and that you have no leaks, reinstall the note pipes in proper order, making sure that the lifting cam on each one fits under the cam follower on the pallet arm. Check each one for smooth operation before installing any pistons. Install the note button/pistons one at a time, making sure at each piston that none of its pegs contact their bell crank levers when the lifting cam is touching the underside of the cam follower on the pallet arm, as this would eventually cause the corresponding note pallet to leak. Provide some clearance between the peg and the lever as follows. You can save time and minimize the amount of bending by first bending the lifting cam lever (the single short lever that contacts and lifts the cam follower on the pallet arm) on each pipe to provide minimal lash at the first lever you adjust on that pipe. Bending the lifting cam to put the first lever into proper position relative to the piston peg should put all the other levers on that pipe in pretty close adjustment also. For minor adjustments of subsequent levers on that same pipe, bend the lever rather than the lifting cam. Bending the lifting cam later would put all the previously adjusted levers on that pipe out of adjustment. You must maintain at least some minimal amount of lash (clearance) between each of the pegs on the side of the piston and the lever it will contact when that button is pushed. However, don't allow too much clearance, as this could cause the button to rest lower than the others and might cause some notes of a chord to sound later than others. Barely perceptible clearance is enough. A 50th of an inch (1/2 mm) is about the most you should allow. You control this clearance by slightly bending the lever while preventing the pipe from rotating. You can prevent the pipe from rotating by firmly holding two or three other levers on the same pipe. I use 4-inch long pieces of 1/8-inch o.d. steel tubing (automotive brake line) slipped down over the levers as bending tools. Pushing two or three levers in one direction while pushing one lever in the opposite direction should cause the one to bend, but sometimes one of the others bends, too, and if this is one you have already adjusted, it will now be out of adjustment. For this reason, you must check the clearance at each peg and lever a second time, after all levers are initially adjusted. A further complication stems from the fact that if one lever is too tight against a piston peg, it will hold the bell crank (pipe) in such a position to create clearance at all other levers on that pipe. When you go back and properly adjust the tight one a bit farther from its peg, it allows all the other levers on that pipe to rotate closer to their pegs. If that rotation exceeds the clearance at one of those pegs, that peg will now be too tight. When that one is eased, another may become too tight. You may have to chase these diminishing clearances back and forth along the pipe to make certain none of its levers are tight against their pegs. This is extremely important, because as the new valve facings compress slightly over time under spring pressure and the impact of repeated closings, the clearance in the linkage will be slightly diminished. If there is no clearance to begin with, the compressed valve will not seal, and you will have an external leak. Once all the note pistons are installed and their levers are adjusted, install the wooden cap strip onto the slotted guide. Warning: if any of the cap strip screw holes have stripped threads down inside the slotted wooden guide, do not force the next larger screw size into the hole, as this will probably crack the wood and bulge it into one of the slots, causing that bass button to stick. The best way to repair a stripped screw hole is to glue in a soft wood plug and tap new threads into that. The softer the wood, the smaller the risk of splitting the slotted guide when you thread the screw into it. You can help prevent splits by temporarily supporting the segment holding the screw. Wedge thin plastic strips alongside the pistons in the slots on each side of this segment while you drill your pilot hole and tap in the new screw. Or take those pistons out and fill the slots snugly with wood or plastic plugs. But don\u2019t force your plugs in too tightly, or that, too, might crack the slotted guide. Even with this support you must be very careful not to split the wood. If it splits despite your best efforts, you will have to glue and clamp it back together, then use a thin metal file to clean the affected slot as required to allow the piston to move smoothly through it. Once the note piston cap strip is securely in place, install the slotted wooden guide for the chord pistons and install just the major and minor chord pistons. Naturally, you must adjust the clearance between each of the piston pegs and its lever as you go. Once again, you can save time by bending the lifting cam on the pipe to set the proper clearance at the first lever on that pipe. That should put all subsequent levers on that pipe into pretty close adjustment so relatively little bending will be required on those subsequent levers. Once all the major and minor chord pistons are in, install the plastic separator strip in the slot in the button side of the slotted guide and secure it with the little plastic tabs glued over the slot (or with screws or nails if that is how it was initially secured). Take special care not to drop any of the plastic tabs, as they will fall down between and under the pistons and will be very difficult to retrieve. You won't want to leave them down there, either, as they could lodge under a valve and cause a leak. When the plastic separator is secured, install the seventh and diminished pistons, adjusting the levers for each as you go, then finally the wooden cap strip. It is a good idea to check for leaks at every stage; after the pallets are waxed in, after the pipes are installed, after the note pistons are installed, after all the major and minor chord pistons are in, and again at the end. This way, if you detect a leaking valve somewhere along the way, you will know that you caused it during the current assembly stage, making it far easier to find and correct the problem. With your bass machine reassembly and setup complete, it is time to reinstall the bass cover, making sure to guide the air release button through its hole as you go. Install the bass cover screws, re-secure the bass strap, and play yourself a congratulatory song. By properly setting up your bass machine, you have just completed one of the more challenging accordion repair tasks.

To have any hope of success, you must deduce their proper order, which may not always be possible. Start by sorting the note pipes separately from the chord pipes. This is simple because each note pipe has three or four short levers in addition to the cam lever, while each chord pipe has many more and much longer levers. Next, determine the order of the reeds in the bass reed blocks by sounding them and naming their notes. Label each valve (directly under each reed you identify) with the name of its note. If the reeds and valves are in chromatic scale order, then you can assume that the note pipes must be arranged basically in the order of the positions of their cam levers along the pipe. That is, the one with the cam lever nearest to one of the ends will go in first, under the shortest valve arm, the pipe with its cam lever second nearest to that same end will go in second, under a slightly longer valve arm, and so on. However, as described in the chapter on disassembling the bass machine, in some accordions there are some discontinuities in that order, and some sections may even be in reverse order. These discontinuities will become obvious when you come to a valve whose cam follower lever is not long enough to reach out over the cam lever on what you might expect to be the next pipe. At this point you will have to find another pipe whose cam lever is properly positioned to lift this cam follower. In fact, you may have to back out a few pipes to find the correct new starting place. This would be a good time to look for evidence of wear on the underside of the valve lifting arms, which if present will tell you where the cam levers formerly contacted them. Use a light and a small mirror to examine the undersides, and mark the location of the worn area on top of the arm with a pencil or a permanent marker. If you are lucky enough to find such wear, then your puzzle is solved. All you have to do is install each pipe in the position that will cause its cam lever to contact the underside of the valve arm at the old wear point. If the accordion is new enough that no wear is visible, then at this point you will be faced with some inevitable trial and error. However, you should always be focused on the big picture, looking for the right new pattern and the proper place to begin that pattern, rather than trying random pipes. The point is, there is definitely a pattern; the arrangement is never random. The notes will be sequential in chromatic scale order, either up or down, possibly with some discontinuities and possibly with some segments progressing up the scale and some progressing down the scale. Labeling each of your remaining pipes with the name of its note will help you recognize and continue patterns. Each of the twelve pipes (whether note pipes or chord pipes) has its one and only cam lever positioned along the pipe so it can only reach one valve lifting arm, and that valve lifting arm is on the valve for that pipe\u2019s note. Since you already have the valves labeled, matching the pipes with the valves is a simple matter. The only hard part is labeling them because they are so small. I use a piece of masking tape stuck to one of the pipe\u2019s levers like a flag. Once you recognize the pattern developing in the order of the pipes, it will be simple to select the next pipe to install, at least until you reach another discontinuity and must discover the new pattern for the remaining pipes. If you fail to discover the pattern, you will have no real hope of ever getting it back together properly. If the reeds are mounted in circle of fifths order, you can still assume that the pipes will be in some kind of chromatic scale order, but you will also know that they will not be in the order of the positions of their cam levers along the pipe, which makes it much more difficult to visually identify the pipe that belongs in any given location. As in the process for chromatically ordered reeds and valves, you will have to label each of the valves with the name of its note, then find the pipe that has its cam lever correctly positioned to open this valve, and label it, too. You still don\u2019t know which pipe goes in first, but figuring that out will be comparatively easy, as there are now only twelve possibilities. Start by comparing the lengths of the cam follower arms mounted on the bass valves. Obviously, they have to reach out over the assembled pipes far enough to reach the cam lever on the pipe for that note. A very short cam follower arm means the pipe containing the cam lever that will open that valve cannot be too far away. A very long cam follower lever indicates that its pipe is probably farther out. Unfortunately, there may be some ambiguity due to the fact that accordion manufacturers do not always trim off the cam followers at just the right length. Some are left a bit longer then they need to be. Note that some of the valves have their cam follower levers pointing the opposite direction, but the same principle still holds. The pipe must be close enough to that valve\u2019s cam follower to allow the cam lever on the pipe to contact and lift the com follower on the valve. This knowledge, combined with your knowledge of pipe order, should allow you to deduce which pipe goes in first. Or at least narrow it down to very few possibilities. After that, it is just a matter of following the chromatic scale, which is easy once you have each pipe labeled with the name of its note. Once you have the first pipe in its proper place, find the pipe for the next note in the chromatic scale, and install it in second place. Continue up (or down) through the chromatic scale, one pipe at a time. If you reach a point where this does not work because the cam follower does not reach the cam lever, then back up and try one of the other possible pipes in first position, and work up through the chromatic scale from there. When you have the correct pipe in the first position, and all the other pipes in chromatic scale sequence, all the cam followers will reach their cam levers. Naturally, you can also look for wear patterns on the bottoms of the cam followers to see where the cam has been rubbing on it, and position each pipe so its cam rubs at the same spot as it did before. As a final check, in the case of note pipes, install the note buttons and verify that each one properly reaches its pipe lever and that the proper valve opens when the button is pushed (for instance that the C valve opens when the C button is pushed). In the case of chord pipes, install the chord buttons and verify that the pegs on the side of each one contact the three or four levers that open the three or four valves required to make up the right chord for that button. For instance, verify that the three pegs on the side of the C major piston contact the levers that rotate the C, E, and G pipes and that the C, E, and G valves open when the C major button is pushed.","title":"Sorting out mixed up bass pipes"},{"location":"accordion-repair2/#sorting-out-mixed-up-bass-buttons","text":"Each of the bass buttons is unique and must go back in its original place for the bass machine to work properly, so they must be kept in the proper order to ensure that they go back where they belong. If they get mixed up, they will not fit properly and the bass machine will not operate properly. Although I have encountered and repaired some accordions that came to me with a few of the buttons inadvertently switched with others, and thus playing the wrong chords, I have never had to straighten out one that was completely jumbled. I cannot say for certain that it is possible, particularly with regard to the chord buttons, since the number of possible permutations is astronomical and only one of them will work. However, I have received inquiries from people who have suffered this misfortune, so I have prepared this advice, in case it ever happens to you. You may need to modify this procedure slightly to account for the diagonal orientation of each chord family row, but the basic principles should apply. Please note that this procedure is based on the assumption that your note pipes and chord pipes are already installed in the proper order. First note that all the longest pistons are note pistons and therefore belong in the two bottom rows of holes in the bass board (assuming a 120 bass accordion). Notice that each note piston has just one peg on the side of it that must engage a lever on one of the note pipes. Notice also that there is a slightly different distance from the button board to each note pipe, and a corresponding set of twelve different distances from the top of each button down to the peg on the side of its piston. Sort all the note pistons in order according to the distance from the top of the button down to the peg on the side of the piston. This should give you eight piles of three pistons and four piles of 4 pistons. Next, identify the note controlled by each note pipe and label the pipes with their note names. You can do this by sounding the reed that lies behind each valve and identifying the note by ear or with your electronic tuner. Hint: Identifying any two adjacent reeds will allow you to determine whether your bass reeds are laid out in accordance with the chromatic scale (most likely) or in accordance with the circle of fifths, (less likely), which will in turn allow you to extrapolate and label all the other reeds without actually sounding them. Now that you know the names of the notes played by each valve, you can easily determine which pipe opens any particular valve and therefore can assign the proper note name to each pipe. Knowing which pipe plays which note tells you which note is played by the pistons of any particular length, measured from the top of the button to the peg, because only the three or four pistons of the proper length will properly reach the three or four actuating levers on that pipe. In other words, the longest pistons play the note controlled by the most distant pipe, the shortest pistons play the note controlled by the closest pipe, and so on. This allows you to assign a note name to each pile of pistons. With each pile now labeled with its note name, use your knowledge of the bass button layout to determine which three or four holes in the bass button board match each pile of note pistons. Now sort each of your twelve piles of pistons into two sub-piles according to the angle of the offset bend between the flat part of the piston and the button. It is easy to do this by laying the piston on edge on the table and seeing which buttons are thereby lifted farthest off the table. These have the greatest offset angle in order to reach the fundamental bass row of holes, and therefore are your fundamental bass row pistons. The pistons with the smaller offset angle are your counter-bass row pistons.","title":"Sorting out mixed up bass buttons"},{"location":"accordion-repair3/","text":"Background information Why is there so little information available about repairing and tuning accordions? Why haven't experienced repairpersons and tuners shared what they know? Could it be because they want to guard the source of their livelihood? Could it be because they think repairing and tuning accordions is a trade that must be learned over a lifetime or through an old world style apprenticeship under expert supervision, and that sharing a little knowledge with novices would only get people into trouble? Could it be that even though they are good at repairing and tuning, they are not so good at communicating what they know? Could it be simply that there are so few of them and so few of us that they seldom meet anyone who wants to know what they know? If so, then they may sense that the market for their knowledge is so limited that it is simply not worth the time and expense to put what they know into a cohesive, coherent, communicable format. It seems to me that all of these reasons are valid, and that with so many good reasons for the existing information void, it could continue indefinitely if I don't do something about it. So I plan to fill that void, first with this website and later with a another book, which I am currently calling PIANO ACCORDION REPAIR MANUAL AND TUNING GUIDE. The information posted on this website will endure only as long as I continue living and paying the rent on the website server. When that ends, it will all disappear with a click of the server owner's mouse unless I put it into a more lasting format; hence the book idea. I don't expect the book to be a big seller volume-wise, because it will serve only this very tiny niche market that you and I occupy, but to make it even remotely possible that I will be able to recoup the expense of publishing it, I am reserving all copy rights to all the material posted here. Please use the information you find here to educate yourself and to rescue as many old accordions as possible, but do not duplicate any of it for commercial purposes. Thank you for your consideration. I am not a master accordion repairer/tuner. I have had no formal education or apprenticeship in repairing and tuning. I'm quite certain that I do not know everything there is to know about repairing and tuning accordions. I have learned some things about repairing and tuning by reading what others have written, but unfortunately, until now there has been very little available. I have learned primarily by experimenting, and that means often making mistakes and correcting them. I have made many mistakes and I have learned enough from correcting them that I am now quite comfortable doing most repairs and tuning dry and light musette (LMM and LMMH) accordions. However, I am just beginning to learn about tuning full musette (LMMM and LMMMH) accordions. Even though it is still very much a work in progress, I think writing down what I have learned so far may be of value to others taking a similar path. It also provides an opportunity for those who know more about tuning than I to critique what I have written, should they be so generous as to do so. The internet provides a wonderful forum for disseminating information, and for discussing and revising that information. It puts all our heads together, and provides unprecedented opportunities for learning from each other. I have learned much about repairing and tuning accordions by doing it. I learned some more by organizing what I have learned into what I hope is a cohesive, coherent, communicable format, presented here. Since publishing this website I have learned still more from several of my readers who have shared their knowledge and experience. I hope to continue learning by hearing other people's reactions to what I have written. If you see some way to improve or expand upon on what I have written, then I am eager to hear what you have to say. Accordion tuning overview Reeds go out of tune for many reasons, and filing the reed is not always the best remedy. It is best to understand why each reed is out of tune before trying to correct its tuning by filing or scratching the reed tongue. Always look for clues that might indicate the cause of the problem and correct any such problem before tuning. Tune the reed only as a last resort. If you tune first, and correct the original problem later, the reed will once again be out of tune because of the filing or scratching you did. Dirt - For instance, dirt and grime add weight to the reed tongue, throwing it out of tune. Dirt can also increase friction and drag. Cleaning a dirty reed will often put it back in tune, or at least closer to it, so whether or not you see any dirt, wax, or grime on the reed tongue, clean it thoroughly before attempting any tuning (but not before you establish your tuning bellows base reading and tuning bellows target for that reed). See the chapter on cleaning reeds and the chapter on using the tuning bellows. Rust - Rust on the reed tongue throws it out of tune by adding weight to it (iron oxide is heavier than iron). You should brush off all the rust using one of the small brass wire brushes described and shown below. However, after the rust is removed the reed will still be out of tune because it will now be lighter, due to the loss of the iron bound up in the iron oxide). Whenever rust is involved, cleaning, then filing the reed is the only way to get it back in tune. See the chapter on Putting File to Metal. Cracks - Metal fatigue cracks throw reeds out of tune, and filing will not help, at least not for long, because the crack will continue to develop, throwing the reed farther out of tune as it develops. Discard any cracked reed. Loose rivet - If the steel rivet (sometimes a screw) holding the reed tongue to the reed plate is not extremely tight, more of the reed tongue can lift off the reed plate as the tongue swings, effectively increasing the length of the tongue, thereby flattening the pitch. If a reed is difficult to tune because its frequency wanders more than that of its neighbours in response to changes in bellows pressure, try resetting the rivet before tuning. Misalignment \u2013 A loose rivet can also allow the reed tongue to drift out of perfect alignment with the vent. Misalignment of the reed tongue in the vent will usually silence the reed, but slight misalignment can sometimes allow it to keep working, while causing a metallic ringing noise as the tongue brushes lightly against the side of the vent on each oscillation. The friction caused by this metal on metal contact slows the reed significantly, throwing it out of tune. Very slight misalignment can cause the reed to go flat without making any ringing noise. The best remedy in all these cases is to correct the misalignment. See the chapter on Aligning Reed Tongues. Bad Leathers - A stiff, curled, loose, or missing leather can throw a reed out of tune by up to ten cents or more. Surprisingly, until you think it through, the reed tongue that is thrown out of tune is often the one alongside the defective leather, rather than the one under it. The best remedy is to replace the leather. New leathers - A new leather anchored differently than the original (glued along more or less of its length than before) can also throw a reed out of tune (this time the one under it), by up to five cents or more. The easiest and surest way to correct this (once you have replaced the leather and rechecked the tuning in the accordion in order to determine the actual tuning error with the new leather) is to retune the reed with a scratcher or a file. Cracked wax - Cracked wax can throw a reed out of tune by allowing the reed plate to vibrate relative to the reed block (rather than transferring all its vibration energy into the reed block). This usually also causes a significant decrease in volume relative to neighbouring reeds, and often creates a buzzing sound, but sometimes, in the early stages, the only symptom is the reed being out of tune on the flat side. If you scratch or file such a reed to tune it, your victory will be temporary at best, because the reed will continue vibrating itself loose, going farther out of tune until it finally goes silent and falls out. Then when you wax it back in, it will be out of tune because of all the filing you did. Especially if both tongues on the same reed plate are sounding flat, check for cracked wax by pressing the reed plate against the reed block with your thumbnail while the reed is sounding on your test bellows. If the finger pressure causes the reed pitch to sharpen, you will know that the wax has separated from the reed plate, allowing the reed plate to vibrate around the reed tongue. In this case, remove the reed from the reed block, clean all the old wax off the reed and off the reed block, and wax the reed back in with fresh reed wax. Then put the reed block back into the accordion and check the tuning again. A change in the weather - Changes in temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure all impact air density, which is one of the factors determining the frequency at which reed tongues vibrate. Changes in air density affect all the reeds in a similar manner, though, so if all the reeds were tuned under approximately the same atmospheric conditions, the accordion should at least remain in tune with itself as atmospheric conditions change. However, if the tuning job is not completed under the same atmospheric conditions under which it was begun, the reeds tuned under one set of conditions will not be exactly in tune with those tuned under different conditions. For instance, a 20 degree Fahrenheit change in temperature can change the tuning of a reed by 2 or 3 cents. Microphones, plugs, etc. \u2013 Anything installed on top of a reed block that hangs over the edge impinges on the reed tongue\u2019s environment. The reed responds to changes in its surroundings by changing its frequency. This can easily be demonstrated by hanging your thumb over the edge of a reed block right over a reed you are sounding on your test bellows. With your tuner turned on, you can observe the change in tuning as you move your thumb into and back out of the reed tongue\u2019s immediate vicinity. Installation of microphone systems after the accordion has been tuned often result in one or more reeds going out of tune. You will have to decide whether to relocate any such obstacle or to tune the affected reeds to compensate for the obstacle\u2019s presence. Register slides out of alignment - If the register slide is not in the fully open position, the reeds along that bank of reeds can be out of tune. In that case, moving the slide to the full open position will put them back in tune. Normal wear \u2013 Sometimes no reason can be found, in which case we conclude that the reed has gone out of tune as a result of normal wear. This is a cop-out, of course, because there is always a reason, perhaps as simple as the wax being harder than it was at the last tuning, but if we cannot find and correct any of the above problems, we have no choice but to tune the reed. Note that tuning by scratching and/or filing would be helpful only in three or four of the cases described above (rust, new leather, normal wear, and possibly microphones or plugs mounted to the reed block). In all the other cases, scratching or filing before solving the underlying problem would actually be counter-productive, so investigate before you file, and remedy any problems prior to tuning. Spot Tuning Tuning a few problem reeds without re-tuning the whole accordion is called spot tuning. In this case, the amount of filing is usually minimal, if any, and most of the tuning is done with a scratcher. It is far less work than a total re-tuning, because the reeds are generally left in the reed block while you tune. If just a few reeds are out of tune by more than you can comfortably correct with scratching or diagonal filing, you can take them out of the reed block individually (after determining the magnitude and direction of the correction needed), tune them to within a few cents, then wax them back in for their final tuning. That\u2019s a lot easier than re-waxing the entire reed block. Re-tuning Re-tuning, i.e., altering the basic tuning by tuning all the reeds to a different A, or changing a dry tuned accordion to wet (see the chapter on Tuning Musette Reeds), is a much bigger job than spot tuning, as many more reeds are involved and you will probably have to take the reeds out of the reed block for the first stage of tuning. Re-tuning requires a lot of filing in the first stage, and while mounted in the reed block, adjacent reeds and leathers get in your way, making filing difficult. If you have a lot of filing to do, it is much easier to file a reed the same way the reed maker does, with the reed plate out of the reed block and firmly clamped in a vise, with the leathers removed. See \u201cPutting File to Metal\u201d for more details on the mechanics of tuning. Setting reasonable standards of accuracy Don\u2019t be too obsessed with accuracy -_ Whatever the nature of your tuning project, don\u2019t waste time by tuning to greater accuracy than is needed. Electronic tuners are accurate to within 1/10 of a cent, but trying to tune all the reeds in an accordion to this degree of accuracy is a fool's errand for at least four reasons. First, most human ears cannot detect pitch differences smaller than about three cents, so especially on the lower notes there is little reason to exceed that level of accuracy. Second, the tuning of a reed varies from day to day by up to a few cents due to changes in temperature, atmospheric pressure, and humidity (all factors impacting air density). You can spend a lot of time meticulously tuning only to discover the next day (or even later the same day) that all the frequencies are off again. Third, some reeds can vary by a cent or more depending on how long they play. A reed may start out sharp and slightly flatten after sounding for a second or two, in which case there is no rational basis for choosing one condition over the other as a basis for your tuning (do you want your whole notes in perfect tune, or your quarter notes?). Fourth, the frequency of the reed varies with the volume (bellows pressure) because it flexes closer to the rivet as it makes wider swings in response to greater air flow. This brings more of its length into play, lowering its pitch. It is very difficult to tune every reed at exactly the same volume level, or even to check the tuning of the same reed at exactly the same volume twice in a row, so even if you meticulously tune with great precision, you will find it difficult to duplicate or verify your results, even just a minute later. For a partial solution to this problem, see the chapter on Tuning With a Manometer, but the fact remains that extreme accuracy is nearly impossible and not necessary, except in the case of the highest notes in your musette reed set. See the chapter on Tuning Musette Reeds. But don\u2019t be careless, either, as there are other factors to consider which may make accuracy more desirable. First, even though the instrument's absolute tuning will vary from day to day and at different volume levels, the various reeds in it will be influenced by the same external factors and will respond in very similar ways, thus keeping them more or less in tune with each other. So even though under certain conditions the accordion may be slightly out of tune with your electronic tuner or even with other instruments, it will be in tune with itself, which is the most important thing. Second, even though we cannot hear the difference between two pitches two cents apart played sequentially, we can hear the harmonics and possibly the beat created when they are played together, and this contributes significantly to the quality of the sound. Similarly, the natural harmonics and beats created by certain intervals and chords may vary enough to be noticeable to some people with well trained ears (especially at the higher pitches) even though the individual notes may not be perceptibly out of tune. At the lower pitches these harmonics are much less audible and much less sensitive to small tuning errors. Set reasonable standards of accuracy - For these reasons, if I am tuning an entire instrument, I tune dry reeds to within one cent at the highest pitches, to within three cents at the lowest pitches, and to within 2 cents near the middle of the accordion's range. If I am spot tuning, I tune to within one or two cents of the average of several neighboring reeds. After all, the whole accordion may be slightly out of pitch on the day I am spot tuning due to the factors listed above, in which case if I tune one reed to exact pitch as indicated by my electronic tuner, that reed may be out of tune with the rest of the instrument. It makes far more sense to check other reeds nearby, eliminate the outliers, and take an average of the rest. Then tune the subject reed and the outliers to within one or two cents of that average. Accuracy is most important in musette tuning - Note that the above standards apply only to dry reeds. You will find that when tuning musette reeds, a tuning error of a couple of tenths of a cent can make a noticeable difference at the higher pitches. However, in that case you are usually tuning to the beat, rather than to an absolute note value. When tuning to the beat, all that matters is the difference in pitch between the two reeds. This difference can be controlled with great precision because both reeds are sounding together, are operating under identical atmospheric conditions, and are responding to the exact same bellows pressure. Even if atmospheric conditions and/or bellows pressure are different next time, causing both notes to be sharper or flatter, they will both be impacted in approximately the same way. The difference between their frequencies will remain pretty stable, and so will the beat, which is all that matters when you tune to the beat. See the chapter on Tuning Musette Reeds. The real essence of tuning: Investigation, Analysis, and Planning While it is true that tuning accordion reeds involves removing metal from the reed tongues (see the chapter on Putting File to Metal), the real essence of tuning lies in investigation, analysis, and planning. Whether tuning an entire accordion or merely spot tuning a few problem notes, before putting file to metal it is absolutely essential to develop and adhere to a tuning plan that tells you how much to change the tuning of each reed tongue and in which direction. Investigation A=440? - The first step of your investigation is to learn or decide whether this is or will be an A440 accordion or whether it is or will be tuned to some other value for A. An A440 accordion has the A above middle C (the second A up in the clarinet reed set) tuned to 440 hertz, and all other notes follow from that. You will find accordions tuned to A440, A441, and A442, as well as other values. I found one 1933 model tuned to A446. The easiest way to determine which value of A forms the basis of your accordion\u2019s original tuning plan is to use a strobe tuner or \"virtual\" strobe tuner to examine a few of its bassoon reeds or bass reeds to find which A setting gives you an indication of zero cents deviation, or at least the smallest average deviation. Naturally, this investigation must be done with the reeds still mounted in the accordion, because they will vibrate at different frequencies once you take them out of the accordion. You should choose to investigate the bass reeds or the bassoon (L) reeds because they are always straight tuned, whereas one or more sets of your clarinet (M) reeds may be wet tuned, which would give you a misleading result. Piccolo (H) reeds, can also be checked, but being smaller, they are more vulnerable to being out of tune due to an accumulation of dirt and grime, which could also give you a misleading or ambiguous result. You can tune your accordion to any A you want, but discovering and adhering to the original basic tuning is a much easier task than switching to a different value of A. Adhering to the original tuning plan will require much less filing on fewer reeds, and you will probably be able to do it without removing the reeds from the reed blocks. Wet? Or dry? - The second step of your investigation is to determine whether the accordion is wet or dry tuned. That is, does it have more than one set of M reeds, and if so, is one or more of those sets tuned slightly off-pitch to create a tremolo effect (wet tuning, often called musette tuning) when both (or all three) sets play? (For clear instructions on how to identify your accordion\u2019s reed configuration, see Chapters 4, 5, and 8 of PIANO ACCORDION OWNER\u2019S MANUAL AND BUYER\u2019S GUIDE, available on the \"Owner's Manual\" page). If you have two M sets, to determine if it is wet tuned you simply listen for the tremolo. If your ear is not already trained to recognize tremolo, then set your treble switches to play just one M set. Play a single note and while sustaining that note hit the switch that allows just one other M set to play that note along with the first. If you suddenly hear tremolo, it means one of those reeds is slightly out of tune. If you hear tremolo on nearly all notes when both M reeds for those notes sound, the detuning is probably intentional, meaning you probably have Musette tuning. If you hear tremolo on just a few, you probably have a dry tuned accordion in which those few reeds are out of tune. If you hear tremolo when just one clarinet reed is played along with a corresponding bassoon or piccolo reed, then one of those reeds is definitely out of tune. If you have three M reed sets, then you certainly have musette tuning. Use your strobe tuner to identify which set is supposed to be on concert pitch (I call that the clarinet reed set), which set is tuned sharp, and which set is tuned flat (I call these detuned reeds the musette reed sets). In some LMMM and LMMMH accordions both musette sets are tuned sharp, with one being sharper than the other, in which case you will discover this during your investigation. If you have an A440 accordion and an iPhone or an iPad, you can more conveniently investigate all this by using the \"Strobe Tuner Pro\" app from Marcus Cavanaugh, inc. ($2.99 at the iPad App Store). Once you have identified which reed sets are which, label the reed blocks accordingly for future reference. I label each row on each reed block: \u201cbassoon white\u201d, \u201cbassoon black\u201d, \u201cclarinet white\u201d, \u201cclarinet black\u201d, \u201cmusette white\u201d, \u201cmusette black\u201d, etc. (remember, each reed set is divided approximately in half, with each half mounted on a different reed block). Analysis and Planning If you have a dry tuned accordion and wish it to remain dry, there is relatively little analysis and planning to do. You will simply plan to tune all reeds including bass reeds to concert pitch, based on the A (440, 442, etc.) of your choice. If you adhere to the original basic tuning, you will probably not tune every reed, but rather just those that are out of tune by some minimum amount, such as 2 cents or 3 cents or more, especially for the lower notes. See the chapter on tuning dry reeds. If you have a musette accordion (or if you are converting your dry tuned LMMH accordion to musette, the first step in your tuning plan will be to tune all the dry reeds (the bass, bassoon, clarinet, and piccolo reed sets) to concert pitch (based on the proper A for your accordion). But the second and more interesting step is to develop a tuning plan for your musette reeds. Before tuning any musette reeds, you must first arrive at a musette tuning plan that achieves the tremolo beat progression you want to create. If you are merely spot tuning to correct a few bad sounding notes, then you will want to analyze and understand your accordion\u2019s original musette tuning plan (beat progression), so you can tune those few problem reeds to fit the current plan. But if you are tuning the whole instrument, your goal may be to alter its tuning plan/beat progression to one that sounds better to you. Many possible tuning plans - For LMM and LMMH accordions, establishing a tuning plan begins with deciding what beat progression you want. For instance, do you want to hear one beat per second (bps) on the lowest F, with the beat frequency gradually and steadily increasing as you ascend the 41 note harmonic scale to four bps on the highest A? Do you prefer to hear two bps on the lowest F, progressing to eight bps at the highest A? Maybe one bps progressing to six bps is more to your liking, or two to four, or some other progression. Although my American ear does not appreciate tunings wetter than these, in some parts of the world some people claim to like tunings as wild as 4.5 bps at the low F and as much as 30 bps at the high A. Thierry Benetoux, in THE INS AND OUTS OF THE ACCORDION, briefly describes four different beat progression curves, running four full octaves from the D# below our lowest F (which I will call F1) to the D# above our highest A (which I will call A4 (because it is the fourth A on our 41 key keyboard). Mnsr. Benetoux describes his vibrato beats in terms of beats per minute, but if we divide his numbers by 60 to convert to beats per second, and if we plot out his curves, then truncate them to fit our 41 key piano accordion keyboards, we come up with these four curves: \"American att.\" runs from 0.7 bps at F1 to 3.5 bps at A4. \"American\" runs from 0.9 bps at F1 to 4.2 bps at A4. \"Light musette\" runs from 1.6 bps at F1 to 5.3 bps at A4. \"Musette\" runs from 2.2 bps at F1 to 7 bps at A4. Although Mnsr. Benetoux has drawn simple straight lines to represent each of his curves, none of his curves are actually simple straight lines. If you plot them on graph paper with the 41 key scale across the bottom, you can readily see that they all have an inflection point somewhere in the first half of the keyboard, after which the curve rises more steeply. One way to come a bit closer to these curves is to create a linear progression of cents deviation between successive notes, rather than a linear progression of beat frequency. That is, make the incremental decrease in cents deviation between any two adjacent notes be constant, rather than making the incremental increase in beat frequency be constant. The result is very similar, except that a little less of the increase in beat frequency occurs in the lower half of the keyboard and a little more of it occurs farther up the scale. The increase in beat frequency as you advance pitch-wise up the keyboard is still very smooth and the beat frequency increase between any two adjacent notes is still barely perceptible, if at all, but the overall sound of the accordion will be slightly different because the beats will all be a bit slower near the middle of the keyboard than they would have been if you had used a linear beat progression. For LMMM and LMMMH accordions (called \u201cfull musette\u201d accordions), you must not only decide on a desired beat progression for each of the two musette sets paired individually with the dry clarinet set, but you must also consider the beat progression that will result when all three are played together. I don\u2019t yet know how to predict that beat progression, so I can offer you little guidance on this, other than to suggest that you analyse the beat progressions of the individual pairs in a similar accordion whose tuning you like and duplicate that in your own accordion. The main point is that there are a very large number of different tuning curves (beat progressions) possible, and the one that is right for you depends on your personal taste. Whatever your choice, you must then establish the desired beat frequency for each note in between. You might want a nice linear progression, with the beat increasing by the exact same amount between any two successive notes on the scale, or you might want to increase the beat slowly through the first octave or so, then increase it more rapidly the rest of the way up the keyboard. Another possibility is to increase the beat to some maximum near the middle of the keyboard and keep the beat frequency constant from there on up. The only hard and fast rule is to avoid abrupt changes. No note should beat at a significantly different frequency from its immediate neighbors. If you are not yet sure what you want, then before tuning your accordion to a new beat progression, you should listen to many accordions, analyze the beat progression of one you particularly like, and duplicate that tuning on your own accordion. For a quick comparison of several different beat progressions, visit the Fisitalia website and play the short recordings of the six different tunings they offer. Unfortunately, they don't precisely define the full beat progression of each tuning, and the notes played for comparison are only through a one octave C chord near the low frequency end of the keyboard, but you can easily tell the difference, learn to count the beats, see for yourself how the beat frequency increases as you advance up the scale, and perhaps decide which tuning sounds best to you. However, keep in mind that their recordings do not reveal the tunings at the high end of the keyboard, where the beats would be faster, and where really fast beats can sound really awful. Here is the link . Analyzing beat progressions - One way to analyze a beat progression is to compare the beat on each note to a metronome beat. Several digital metronomes are available as free downloads. I use an iPad app called Epic Metronome. I like it because it has a moving graphic presentation of an old fashioned mechanical metronome arm swinging back and forth across the screen, and that visual representation is easy for me to monitor while I\u2019m counting the musette beat. I set the metronome for 30 beats per minute, then I count the beat during two full swings of the arm, which is four seconds. I divide that count by four to get the beat frequency to the nearest quarter beat per second (bps). If you have not yet trained your ear to count the beats, you might start by singing silently along with them, la-la-la-la-la-la, matching each \"la\" to one of the beats. For faster beats, it helps to think in terms of pairs, triplets, and quadruplets of \"la\". For instance, while you might not be able to count ten individual \"la\"s per second, you might be able to count two quadruplets and a pair. With this technique, I can count with confidence up to about 12 bps, which to my taste is beyond the desirable range. By counting the tremolo beat for each note, you can accurately plot the tuning curve for any light musette accordion (LMM or LMMH). As you plot the beats for each note, you are likely to find some deviations from a smooth curve. If you assume these deviations are caused by specific notes being a little out of tune, you can ignore them in order to plot a smooth curve (or a straight line) as a model for tuning your other accordions. However, for some of the wider tunings that you might encounter in some full musette (MMM, LMMM or LMMMH) accordions, you might not be able to count the beat near the upper end of the keyboard range, because it is too fast. In this case, unless you can hear the beat in terms of its pitch as an overtone (can anyone do this? I don't know!), you will have to revert to tuning those notes entirely in terms of cents. BPS versus cents - Although I think it is most informative to speak of musette tuning (at least light musette tuning) in terms of beat, most people still speak of it in terms of cents. For instance, I once saw a list that showed American musette as 10 cents sharp, Italian musette as 15 cents sharp, French musette as 20 cents sharp, Irish as 25 cents sharp, etc. I have seen some sources suggest tunings as wild as 32 cents sharp. Aside from the fact that these wider tunings would sound awful to me, I think their descriptions are misleading, because they seem to suggest that the entire range of notes should all be tuned to the same cents deviation, which is never the case. Sometimes the given number refers to the deviation at the low F on our keyboards, and sometimes it refers to the deviation at A=440. But it never refers to the deviation at the highest A. Regardless of the cents of deviation used at the low end of the keyboard, the deviation is always reduced as we progress up the scale. If it were not, few of us would like the sound. Tuning the high end or even the middle of the keyboard of an LMM or LMMH accordion to large deviations creates a beat so fast that to most American ears it sounds more like fingernails on a blackboard than a beat, and it definitely grates on our nerves. (In MMM, LMMM, and LMMMH accordions, it is said that the presence of the third reed makes the wider tunings tolerable. I plan to do some experimenting on this in the near future as I develop tuning plans for my LMMM acordions.) Regardless of the amount of deviation, or of the differences among our individual tastes, we don\u2019t hear the cents, we hear the beat. The beat frequency is extremely important to the quality of the sound. When tuning musette reeds, we most often tune them to the beat, rather than to some nominal number of cents sharp or flat. Our tuning plan is based on a desired beat progression. What we hear and what we really seek to control is the tremolo beat frequency measured in beats per second. It therefore makes much more sense to describe musette tuning (at least light musette tuning) in terms of beat, rather than cents, and to specify how the beat changes as we progress up the keyboard. Understanding the relationship between hertz, bps and cents - The problem with this approach is that our tuning equipment is calibrated in cents, (one cent equals 1/100 of a semitone), so to be able to use our tuners to achieve a desired beat, we must also understand the exact relationship between cents and beats per second. Unfortunately, that relationship is different for each note. Generally, one cent of difference in pitch has less impact on the beat frequency at the lower notes and more impact at the higher notes. This is because the beat frequency is exactly equal to the difference between the two note frequencies expressed in hertz, and because each cent represents more hertz at the higher notes. For instance, at the lowest clarinet F on our keyboard (174.6 hertz), each hertz of difference (bps) equates to about 10 cents. Near A=220 hertz, each hertz equates to about 8 cents, at A=440 hertz, about 4 cents, at A=880 hertz, about 2 cents, and at the highest clarinet A on our keyboards (A=1760 hertz), each hertz is only about 1 cent (for a more complete discussion of why this is so, see Chapter 27 of PIANO ACCORDION OWNER\u2019S MANUAL AND BUYER\u2019S GUIDE). The mathematical formula for determining the number of cents equivalent to one beat per second at each note boils down to the following: For any given note whose frequency in hertz (cycles per second) is F, the frequency of a note one cent higher is F x 2 to the 1/1200 power, the frequency of a note 2 cents higher is F x 2 to the 2/1200 power, and so on, right on up to a note 100 cents higher, i.e., a full semitone higher, having a frequency of F x 2 to the 100/1200 power (the same as the 1/12 power of 2, which is the basis for an equal temperament 12-note scale). Musette tuning calculations - (We won\u2019t actually do much calculation here, but if even the passing discussion of math bores you, skip now to the cheat sheet.) For a convenient example, let\u2019s take the case of a note 10 cents higher than frequency F. According to the formula, this higher note has a frequency of F x 2 to the 10/1200 power. The hertz difference between these two note frequencies is F x 2 to the 10/1200 power minus F. This hertz difference is exactly equal to the beat frequency that will be generated by playing these two notes together (for a clear, plain language explanation of why this is so, see Chapter 27 of PIANO ACCORDION OWNER\u2019S MANUAL AND BUYER\u2019S GUIDE). Since we are comparing two notes exactly ten cents apart, this beat frequency is the number of tremolo bps that result from ten cents deviation at this particular note. To get the number of cents deviation required to generate just one tremolo beat per second, we must divide 10 by this number. For instance, applying this formula (F x 2 to the 10/1200 power) at piano A4 (440 hertz), tells us that a note ten cents higher has the frequency 442.55 hertz. Subtracting F (440) from 442.55 gives us the difference between these two notes, which is 2.55 hertz. Since each hertz of difference generates one beat per second, we know that these two notes played together will generate a beat of 2.55 bps. In other words, ten cents of difference generates a beat of 2.55 bps at A440. Dividing 10 by 2.55 tells us that 3.92 cents difference generates one beat per second at A440. The cheat sheet This formula may appear difficult to evaluate, but in fact it is quite easy on an Excel spreadsheet, and I have done it for you and posted the results below. The chart shows how many cents difference are required at each note to achieve 1 bps tremolo beat. Double that many cents will generate a 2 bps tremolo beat. If you want to generate a 3.25 bps tremolo beat on a particular note, multiply the cents value of 1 bps by 3.25. This chart is an essential aid when we are tuning to the beat. Let's say we hear a beat of 2.25 bps on one note that, according to our tuning plan is supposed to produce a beat of 3.25 bps, that is, it should beat 1 bps faster. Assuming this particular musette set is tuned sharp, the chart tells us how many cents we need to further sharpen this particular reed in order to increase the beat by one more bps. If we are tuning a set that is tuned flat, it tells us how many cents we need to flatten it. If the beat of a particular note needs to be raised or lowered by 0.75 bps, then multiply the number in the chart by 0.75, and so on. This is your cheat sheet. It allows you to quickly calculate how many cents correction you need to apply to the current tuning in order to alter the current beat pattern to fit your tuning plan for each individual note. It is the single most essential ingredient for successful musette tuning, yet I have never found it published anywhere. As far as I know, this is its first appearance. Proper musette tuning procedure With this background information in mind, we can now recap in outline form the proper procedure for tuning a musette accordion, which is the most complex type to tune. Details for steps 1, 2, and 3 have already been provided. Details for steps 4, 5, and 6 are provided later on. For a dry tuned accordion, skip steps 5 and 6. Step 1: Determine the basis of its tuning (A=440, etc.). Set your electronic tuner to this standard, and save the setting (or the next time you turn it on, it may revert to the default setting). Step 2: Check all reeds for security and condition (wax, leathers, rust, grime), and remedy any defects. Step 3. Identify and label each reed set. Step 4: Tune dry reeds as necessary Step 5: Develop your musette tuning plan in terms of the beat progression you want. Step 6: Tune your musette reeds, one musette reed set at a time. Step 4: Tuning dry reeds Using the tuning bellows - When tuning, it is important to understand that each reed tongue will vibrate at a different frequency in the accordion than on your tuning bellows. This is due to several factors including reversed air flow on the tuning bellows and differences in physical surroundings. Although the reeds will have to be tuned outside the accordion on your tuning bellows, you will want them to be in tune when installed in the accordion. You must establish a tuning bellows target value for each reed tongue that will put it in tune once it is back in the accordion. For your dry tuned reeds, measure how many cents each reed tongue is out of tune, and in which direction, while the reeds are installed in the accordion. Unless you are using Dirk's Tuner, which can listen to more than one reed at a time, you must turn off all reed sets other than the one you are measuring. If you have an A440 accordion, you can use the Marcus Cavanaugh iPad/IPhone app referenced above, but if you are tuning to some other value of A, then you will have to use a strobe tuner or virtual strobe tuner that can be set to that standard. I use the Peterson VS-II Virtual Strobe tuner, which used to list for $359, but has been discontinued and is now available used in places like eBay, often for around $100. Express any deviation you find as a correction factor. For instance if you find that a reed is three cents flat, then your correction factor will be to sharpen it three cents. Use the tuning bellows to measure and determine when you have achieved your correction factor. For the sake of efficiency (to avoid opening the accordion hundreds of times) measure the tuning of all the reeds in one set (bassoon, clarinet, or piccolo) at one sitting and make a chart showing the amount and direction of the required correction for each reed tongue. Then test those same reeds on the tuning bellows (still mounted in their reed blocks, naturally, and with leathers still installed), and note on the chart how far out of tune each one appears to be on the tuning bellows and in which direction. You will not be tuning to eliminate this indicated error, as it will probably be different from the real error noted while the reed block was in the accordion. You will use this tuning bellows reading only as a base line for calculating your tuning bellows target value for each reed tongue. Calculate the desired tuning bellows target value by applying the correction factor determined while the reed block was still mounted in the accordion, and note the tuning bellows target value on your chart. Then tune the reed tongue to that target value on the tuning bellows. Use the tuning bellows just to measure the amount of correction being made. The tuning bellows target value will not be zero (zero cents out of tune) unless the reed happens to have the same frequency inside the accordion as it does on the tuning bellows, which is uncommon. For example, a typical reed tongue might be out of tune by +6 cents (6 cents too sharp) in the accordion. In that case you will note a required correction factor of minus (-) 6 cents (flatten it by 6 cents to bring it to zero cents out of tune in the accordion). If that same reed tongue is out of tune by +9 cents on the tuning bellows, your tuning bellows target value will be +3 cents (9 minus 6) and you will flatten it by 6 cents to get it there. When you put it back in the accordion and test it again, it should be exactly in tune. As a final check after tuning to make sure your allowed dry reed tuning tolerances are not too great, play each possible dry pair of reeds (a dry pair being the one you are tuning plus its octave mate from another dry reed set) together and listen for any beat that would indicate one of the reeds is out of tune, and retune any problem pairs to eliminate the beat. For instance, if your tolerances allow the low F in your bassoon set to be up to 3 cents flat and the low F in your piccolo set to be up to 2 cents sharp, and if both happen to be at opposite extremes of their tolerance ranges, this 5 cent difference might result in an audible beat when they are played together. In this case, one of those reeds will have to be tuned closer to the value of the other to eliminate the beat. In most cases with these stated tolerances, the pairs won\u2019t be at opposite ends of their allowable ranges and will be well enough matched to preclude any noticeable beat. Only if one of the reeds is near one limit of the tolerance and the other reed is near the opposite limit will you have a problem. Have a clear, well organized worksheet where you can post the current tuning bellows reading, the correction factor to be applied, and the resulting tuning bellows target value for each reed tongue. It helps to color code the worksheet columns containing your inner reed tongue readings, correction factors, and targets to help prevent inadvertently reading the value for an external tongue while trying to tune an internal tongue. Constantly double check to ensure that you are looking at the correct target value for the reed tongue you are tuning and that you are tuning the correct tongue on the correct reed in the correct reed set, and that you are tuning it in the right direction (i.e., not inadvertently sharpening it when you actually need to flatten it). Organization, focus, and perspective- Skill, dexterity, and judgment are all required to successfully tune, but of equal importance are organization, focus, and perspective. It is important to be organized and focused, yet always keep in mind the big picture in order to avoid inadvertently tuning the wrong reed, or the wrong tongue, or tuning in the wrong direction, or by the wrong amount. Many pitfalls - There are many opportunities for error, confusion, or distractions to ruin your tuning job. For instance, your tuner could be set to A=442 or some other value not applicable to your accordion, which would give you the wrong readings for every reed. Or you could misread the tuner readout and write down that the reed must be sharpened, when it really needs to be flattened. You could accidentally enter the value for the inner reed tongue in the column for outer reed tongue values, or on the line for a different note, or accidentally write a minus sign when you meant to write a plus sign, or misread your own handwriting. Once you have the values written down, you could miscalculate the correction required or you might calculate correctly but use a wrong value in the calculation, perhaps due to reading it from the wrong column on your chart. Even if you avoid all measurement, calculation, and tabulation errors and produce a perfectly accurate chart of all the reeds and their required corrections and tuning bellows target values, there are still plenty of opportunities for error during the actual tuning of the reeds. You might inadvertently tune the inner tongue to the value desired for the outer tongue, or tune the wrong reed altogether, or be on the wrong reed block, or sharpen a reed when you should have flattened it. You might be closing the tuning bellows (sounding the interior reed) while thinking you are checking the tuning you just did on the exterior reed. Whatever the reason for the error, I know from experience that it is very disheartening to find that you have taken metal off the wrong reed tongue, or off the wrong end of the right reed tongue. You should never take your eye or hand off the reed you are tuning. If you must look away to pick up a tool, then keep your finger on the reed plate you wish to tune. If you don't, you may find yourself tuning the wrong reed. Practice on accordions of little value in order to learn to systematically avoid all these pitfalls before tuning an accordion of value. Even if you have got everything right so far, and are tuning the correct reed tongue in the right direction toward the correct target value, you are still not out of the woods. It is very easy to accidentally take off too much metal and overshoot your tuning target. Most often this happens when light filing or scratching is apparently not changing the tuning (or maybe even changing it in the wrong direction) so you get a little more aggressive with it. This frequently occurs when your scratching or filing is displacing (relocating) metal, but not actually removing it, or perhaps displacing enough metal to cancel out the tuning impact of any metal you remove. For instance, filing the tip of the reed tongue (to sharpen the pitch) can actually flatten the pitch by shifting burrs of metal (mass or weight) toward the reed tip rather than removing them entirely. Similarly, scratching the lower third of the reed (to flatten the pitch) can sometimes sharpen the pitch by plowing up tiny burrs and shifting them toward the fixed end of the reed rather than removing them entirely. If the next pass of the file or scratcher finally removes these burrs, you will get a sudden jump in the reed frequency, perhaps well beyond your target value. Then you are faced with taking metal off the opposite end to correct the overshoot. You can avoid this trap by carefully and thoroughly scraping off all burrs before taking each measurement. In any case, the important thing to remember is that you sharpen pitch by shifting the reed tongue's center of gravity toward the fixed end, and you flatten pitch by shifting the center of gravity toward the free end. You can shift the center of gravity either by removing metal or by shifting metal around. For more details on how this is done, see the chapter on Putting File to Metal. There are many other tuning pitfalls to avoid. If you let your thumb or any part of your hand hang over the edge of the reed block above the reed while sounding that reed on your tuning bellows, the proximity of your hand will flatten the pitch of the reed. This effect may overshadow the effect of your most recent scratching or filing, providing erroneous feedback and leading you to erroneous conclusions about whether or not additional filing is required. Not having the opening in the bottom of the reed block fully over the opening in the top of your tuning bellows will also give erroneous readings. Gripping the reed block tightly while filing or scratching a reed can compress or displace or wrinkle the leather on some other reed, which can change that other reed's tuning. Similarly, replacing a leather can change the tuning, especially if the length of the glued-down portion of the new leather is not exactly the same as on the old. When you begin tuning that reed, blindly applying the previously determined correction factor may produce an undesirable result. If rough handling or replacing leathers has changed the tuning of any reed, a new correction factor must be determined for that reed before attempting to tune it. Naturally this requires putting the reed block back in the accordion and checking the tuning of that reed again. Great care must be taken not to damage the reed tongue or the reed plate while tuning. This is especially important in the highest pitch reeds in the piccolo reed set, say, from the highest A down to the C below. It is very common to find these reeds silent due to being damaged by excessive force during a previous tuning. I have found them arched, cupped, twisted, even kinked. Reeds with any of these defects are impossible to voice properly, and should be replaced with new. However, they can sometimes be straightened with a bit of tedious careful work under 10x - 20x magnification (see the chapter on \u201cStraightening Piccolo Reeds\u201d). Reeds can be ruined by removing too much metal in one place. Creating thin spots can theoretically change the timbre and encourage cracks. Reeds can also be ruined by bending them too far while getting them in position to file, or by pressing too hard with the file or the scratcher, or by filing or scratching without providing proper support behind the reed tongue (the smaller the reed, the more vulnerable it is to this kind of mishandling). Inadvertently narrowing the reed tongue or shortening its tip can ruin a reed by increasing the clearance between the reed tongue and the vent. Scratching or nicking the reed plate at the edge of the vent can similarly ruin the reed. Occasionally the file will drag a metal burr or metal filing to the edge of the reed tongue, where it will wedge between the reed tongue and the vent, preventing the reed from sounding properly. These can usually be removed by passing a .0015\" metal feeler gauge between the tongue and the vent, or by dragging it along the edge of the reed tongue, or sometimes by plucking the reed until it vibrates freely. However, don't push the feeler gauge too far into the vent, or you may damage or dislodge the leather on the opposite side. And don't pull the reed too far up to pluck it, or you may alter its voicing. More insidious is the effect of a tiny burr on the edge of the tongue that serves to slow the reed just enough to put it slightly out of tune rather than stopping it entirely. This can mislead you into thinking the reed must be sharpened in pitch, when all it really needs is to be wiped clean. If you file it again before wiping it clean, you may overshoot your target value. Similarly, the file or scraper or your finger can drag soft wax or other contaminant to the reed tongue and deposit it there, which will alter the center of gravity and thus the frequency until you wipe it clean. It is important to remove all wax from the top of the reed plate before tuning any reed, in order to minimize the possibility of dragging that wax onto the reed tongue during tuning. Occasionally, your efforts to support the interior reed tongue from below will dislodge or damage the interior leather, throwing the interior reed tongue alongside of it suddenly out of tune and skewing your readings for it. If you don\u2019t notice this problem right away, the erroneous and misleading feedback from your electronic tuner may cause you to file or scratch more than necessary. Once you discover and correct the problem, you may find that you have significantly overshot your tuning target and that you now have to tune that same reed tongue back in the opposite direction. One major difficulty in checking the tuning and determining correction factors is the fact that reed frequency decreases (flattens) under higher air pressures, especially on the lowest frequency reeds. You might have a reed perfectly in tune at one bellows pressure, yet the next time you test it you will get a different reading if you use a slightly different bellows pressure. This makes it impossible to tune efficiently, as you cannot tell whether the change in reading is due to the scratching you just did, or to differences in bellows pressures. And if you have one reed perfectly in tune at one bellows pressure and another reed perfectly in tune at some other bellows pressure, then whenever you play those notes together, they will be out of tune with each other. Tuning at constant pressure with a manometer - This problem can be avoided only by tuning and testing at least all the low note reeds at the same bellows pressure (the low notes are the most sensitive to pressure changes). A simple home-made U- tube manometer can be used to measure bellows pressure and to provide a reference that allows you to apply the same bellows pressure to every reed. I used some old clear plastic medical oxygen hose for the tubing, food coloring to color an ounce or so of water, an eye dropper to put the colored water into the clear tubing. I mounted the tubing on an empty white plastic gallon jug to hold it in the proper U-shape, to support it in an upright viewing position, and to provide a white background behind the red liquid. To work properly, one end of the tubing must be open to the atmosphere and extended a few inches above the liquid level to prevent any liquid from being blown out under bellows pressure. The other end must be looped to a similar height and connected to the bellows through some convenient length. To connect the manometer to the tuning bellows I drilled an oversized hole in the top cover plate and used a piece of foam rubber as a stopper to seal around the hose. Before installing it, I made a hole through the foam stopper and forced the hose through the hole. To connect the manometer to the accordion I remove the bass plate and the air release button and valve, and insert the manometer hose into the air release valve port, again using a piece of foam rubber as a stopper to seal around the hose. I route the hose out through the air release button hole in the bass plate and reinstall the bass plate so I can play the accordion while it is hooked to the manometer. I mark the level of the liquid at rest in the manometer on the plastic jug behind each leg of the U-tube with a felt pen, then while playing the accordion normally, I note the fluctuations in liquid level with varying bellows pressure and sound volume. Based on those observations I select an appropriate liquid level (bellows pressure) to use in tuning and mark that on the jug behind each tube, one for each bellows direction. When measuring the tuning of any reed in the accordion or on the tuning bellows, I can now hold constant bellows pressure at the appropriate level using the manometer as a reference. Atmospheric factors - Even at constant bellows pressure, the tuning of any reed will vary from day to day due to changes in air temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure, all of which impact air density, one of the important determinants of the frequency at which any reed will vibrate. Expansion due to temperature changes also minutely changes the length of the reed tongue and hence the location of its center of gravity relative to the fixed end, another major determinant of the reed's vibration frequency. We intuitively expect to see reeds slow down due to an increase in temperature, as the reed tongue expands, carrying its center of gravity away from the fixed end. However, it is apparently not quite that simple, as on a recent test of three reeds (Piano A3, A4, and A5) at three distinct temperatures (48, 68, and 88 degrees Fahrenheit) I found, contrary to my expectations, that all three reeds were actually 1 \u00bd to 2 \u00bd cents sharper at 68 degrees than they had been at 48 degrees, although at 88 degrees the trend had reversed and the largest one was back to being about half a cent flatter than it had been at 68 degrees. (I would need more data points to plot a curve that would reveal at what temperature the trend actually reverses for each reed.) I can offer no theoretical explanation of why this reversal occurs. Tuning variations due to temperature changes are not a problem if all the reeds are tuned at about the same temperature, because they will change together. But if you tune one reed set on a 60 degree day and another on an 80 degree day, you may have to compensate for the temperature difference. The lowest notes often seem unstable - The lowest note bassoon reeds are more difficult to tune because they tend to drift in frequency, even at constant bellows pressure. The higher notes vibrate at a consistent frequency that your tuner can reliably measure to within one tenth of one cent, but on the lowest notes the tuner readout fluctuates, sometimes by several cents, sometimes eventually settling down to one value, but more often oscillating through some range of values. After you file or scratch, you can't know for sure how much of the change in readout is due to your tuning and how much is due to drift, or to measuring at a different phase of the oscillation cycle. You have to take an average, or decide to always use the value showing after some arbitrary but consistently measured period of time, such as two seconds after the reed first sounds. I hypothesize that this drift may be due to the uneven weight distribution along the length of the reed tongue (the largest treble reeds are much thicker and heavier at the tip), or it may be due to the large mass of the reed tip intermittently mobilizing more of the reed tongue\u2019s length by occasionally lifting it off the reed plate closer to the rivet. Whatever the reason, you will not be able to tune these reeds to the degree of accuracy that is possible at the higher notes. Final check - Once all the reeds in a set have been tuned, check the operation of every reed in both directions on your tuning bellows (in case any have become jammed by tuning debris) then put the reed blocks back in the accordion and check the tuning again. This will highlight any errors or discrepancies that you will need to correct in a second round of tuning. Also check for proper voicing, as the forces imposed on the reeds during tuning can upset the voicing (especially on the smallest reeds), and you will want to correct any voicing problems at the same time you are correcting any final tuning discrepancies. Voicing the reeds - Voicing involves setting the free tip of the reed tongue to the optimum height above the reed plate. The optimum height is that which will require the least possible amount of air to get the reed tongue moving, yet not so close that it chokes (balks under sudden high bellows pressure). The proper height is typically about one reed thickness, but this is really just a starting point. The actual optimum height must be determined by feel and by ear. If the clearance is too great, the reed responds slowly and sluggishly, especially under light bellows pressure, because too much air leaks through the resulting excessive clearance around the reed tongue. If the clearance is too narrow, the reed will not sound at all under sudden high bellows pressure, presumably because its initial stroke is too short to accumulate enough spring energy to overcome the air pressure and bounce back, as would be required for it to begin oscillating. Finding the sweet spot can be tricky because if the clearance is ever so slightly less than the optimum, the reed can partially choke, that is, it can refuse to sound immediately, but eventually get going, which can sound a lot like a reed responding sluggishly because it has too much clearance. This can fool you into reducing the clearance some more, which will cause it to choke completely on the next trial. Generally, if a reed's threshold of response under very light bellows pressure is identical to its immediate neighbors, it is probably properly voiced. Any reed that requires more bellows pressure than its neighbors probably needs voicing. For detailed instructions on voicing reeds, see the article on page \"Accordion Repair 1\". Step 5: Developing your musette tuning plan Developing your musette tuning plan involves several tasks: a) deciding what beat progression you want for each musette reed set, b) documenting the current beat progression for each M set paired individually with the dry clarinet set, c) comparing the existing beat progression to your desired beat progression to get a tuning correction factor measured in bps for each reed tongue, d) calculating an equivalent tuning correction factor measured in cents for each reed tongue, e) measuring each reed tongue\u2019s current tuning on the test bellows in terms of cents, and f) applying the calculated cents correction factor to get a tuning bellows target value (in cents) for each reed tongue. I usually complete steps a) through d) for the whole reed set before going on to e) and f), which I complete for each reed tongue just before I clean and then tune it. I tune each reed tongue to match its tuning bellows target value before going on to e) and f) for the next reed tongue. Here is a more detailed explanation of each task: a) Deciding what beat progression you want was covered earlier under \u201cMany possible tuning plans\u201d. To be useful during tuning, it must be in the form of a list of the desired beat frequencies to the nearest 0.1 bps for each note on your treble keyboard. b) Documenting the current beat progression was partially covered earlier under \u201cAnalyzing beat progressions\u201d. To that I can add a few tips: With the reeds in the accordion, and with the treble switches set to play just the dry clarinet set and the single musette set you are tuning, play each note in both bellows directions and make a list of the current beats for each note in each bellows direction. If switches don\u2019t allow this reed combination, then insert paper strips under the reed blocks to block air flow to the rows of reeds you do not wish to hear. If your accordion has more than one musette reed set, repeat this for each of those sets individually paired with the dry clarinet set. c) Comparing the current beat progression to the desired beat progression involves simple subtraction and listing the correction required (in bps) in the proper column for each reed tongue, paying careful attention to the direction of the required correction. d) Calculating an equivalent tuning correction factor measured in cents is just multiplying the bps correction factor by the cheat sheet bps-to-cents conversion factor for that note. I use a chart which I call my Musette Reed Tuning Worksheet. It has 12 columns and 45 rows. The 4 top rows are for labeling and grouping columns, and the other 41 are dedicated 1 row for each treble note. The first column contains the names of the notes, the second and third columns are for entering the beginning bps for each bellows direction (as measured with reeds in the accordion), and the fourth and fifth are for listing the correction required (in bps) for each bellows direction in order to match the desired beat progression. The sixth column is just a reproduction of my cheat sheet, listing the cents per bps conversion factor for each note, and the seventh and eighth columns are for listing the calculated correction factor in cents for each bellows direction. This much I complete before taking the reeds out of the accordion. The last four columns are for listing: e) beginning cents deviation for each tongue as measured on the tuning bellows, and f) the tuning bellows target value for each tongue, which is derived by applying the cents correction factor to the beginning cents deviation for each tongue. To help keep the data properly organized and prevent errors, I use yellow highlighting to denote all columns pertaining to inner reed tongues. The completed chart constitutes a complete formulation of my musette reed tuning plan for one musette reed set. Step 6: Tuning Musette Reeds Tune your musette reeds one musette reed set at a time. Before removing the reed blocks from the accordion, make sure each row of reeds is properly labeled, as discussed in \u201cWet or Dry?\u201d, above. Establish the tuning bellows base line and the tuning bellows target value for each reed as you go, as detailed in e) and f) of step 5, above, then carefully clean each reed before you tune it. Check it on the test bellows again to see how much it improved due to the cleaning. Then tune each musette reed tongue to its tuning bellows target value, just as you did for the dry reed sets. Correcting errors and newly discovered problems \u2013 After all the musette reeds are tuned, put the reed blocks back in the accordion and check every musette reed pair again, in each bellows direction, making note of any needed corrections to the beat frequency on a fresh Musette Reed Tuning Worksheet. Use the cheat sheet column to convert each bps correction factor to cents. Establish a new tuning bellows base line for each reed tongue needing additional tuning, apply the cents correction factor to arrive at a new tuning bellows target value for each reed tongue needing additional tuning, and tune each of those reed tongues to its target value, just as you did the first time through. Occasionally, you may discover that the beat frequency for one of the pairs increases or decreases with changes in bellows pressure. Even though the higher note reeds are generally less prone to frequency drift in response to changes in bellows pressure, in the case of musette pairs the beat is so sensitive to minute changes in frequency that if one member of the pair drifts ever so slightly more than the other, the beat will change noticeably. If your final check reveals a reed pair whose beat varies noticeably with bellows pressure, then one of those reeds may have a loose rivet. I don\u2019t mean \u201cfalling out loose\u201d, or even \u201cwandering off-center\u201d loose. I mean just barely loose enough to allow a tiny bit more of the reed tongue to lift off the reed plate right next to the rivet whenever you get the reed tongue swinging wide by playing it at high volume. This increases the effective length of that reed tongue, lowering its pitch. In this case, you will have to identify which reed tongue is causing the problem and reset its rivet. If the musette set you are tuning is sharper than your clarinet set, a slower beat under high bellows pressure indicates the musette reed is going flat, while a faster beat under high pressure indicates that the clarinet reed is the culprit. If the musette set you are tuning is flatter than the clarinet set, then a slower beat implicates the clarinet reed, while a faster beat implicates the musette reed. In either case, if the problem occurs while opening the bellows, the inner tongue is causing the problem. If it occurs while the bellows is closing, the outer tongue is the one to repair. You can also identify which reed tongue you have to tighten by testing all four reed tongues individually on your test bellows with the Marcus Cavanaugh tuning app running on your iPad. Watch the readout as you vary tuning bellows pressure. If the frequency of any one of those tongues wanders more under bellows pressure changes than the other four, you will know to reset the rivet on that tongue. However you identify it, take the offending reed out of the reed block, place one end of the problem rivet on the edge of an anvil (just that rivet should contact the anvil, not the whole reed plate, not any reed tongue, and not both rivets) and give the other end of that rivet a couple of light raps with a hammer. Don\u2019t hit it too hard, as you don\u2019t want to distort the aluminum reed plate, which is relatively soft. Wax the reed back into the reed block, install it in the accordion, and test that pair again. If your hammer taps were sufficient, the problem will be solved, and the beat will be stable. However, it may not be stable at precisely the bps you want, in which case you will have to retune the reed tongue whose rivet you reset. With your cheat sheet in hand, it will be easy to arrive at a new correction factor in cents and a new tuning bellows target value, just as you did before. Musette Tuning tolerances - A look at the cheat sheet reveals that the tuning tolerances must be considerably tighter for musette reeds than for dry reeds, especially near the upper end of the 41 note scale. Tune to within two cents of your target at the low end of the keyboard, because at the lowest F, 2 cents equates to about 0.2 bps, which is as much accuracy as you need. Gradually decrease this margin of error as you ascend the scale, until at the very top tune to the nearest 0.2 cents, because at the highest A, 0.2 cents equates to about 0.2 bps. If each note is tuned to within 0.2 bps of your tuning plan it will sound perfectly tuned to anyone. If you let the tolerances wander to about 0.5 bps, some people (other accordion tuners, mostly) will notice. Most people are oblivious to beat frequencies, and will not notice anything wrong unless the beat is way off, in which case they will know it sounds bad, but they won\u2019t know why. Cleaning reeds The time honored way to clean reeds is by taking them out of the reed block, cleaning off the wax, and soaking them in benzine or carbon tetrachloride. That is not practical if you are not re-waxing the accordion, and in any case, I do not recommend using such toxic chemicals. Some people clean them in a liquid bath in an ultrasonic cleaner, but I can\u2019t help wondering if there is any water in that liquid, and if so, what happens to the water that gets in between the reed plate and the rivet tongue all around the rivet. I prefer to clean mechanically. I use a tiny brass wire brush which I make by pulling individual tufts from a small wooden handled wire brush available at hardware stores (find a brush with the straight brass wire bristles, don\u2019t buy one with curly bristles). Grip each tuft individually near the bottom with needle nose pliers and pull it out of the wood. Crimp a short length of steel tubing (I use 1/8\u201d automotive brake line) onto each individual tuft to use as a handle, and snip the bristles to about 1/4\" long, making a stiff narrow brush that fits down into the reed vent. Crimp one tuft in each end of the tube and on a few of them bend one set of bristles 90 degrees for working inside the reed block. These brushes work well for cleaning all but the underside of the outer reed tongue (unless you remove the reed from the reed block, in which case all surfaces are equally accessible). If you are working with a reed still mounted in its reed block, work from the outside, in order not to have to remove the interior leather. Lift the outer tongue and scrape the underside of it with a dull blade, such as the edge of a .004\u201d or thicker metal feeler gauge, then pluck it to shake off the debris. This is not a perfect way to clean, but it is better than no cleaning at all. Then check its tuning again. After cleaning the reed in this manner you may have to file less than you originally thought, and sometimes you may not have to file at all. Sometimes cleaning alone brings the reed back into tune. Don\u2019t clean it before you establish its tuning bellows target value, though, or you will have to put it back in the accordion to establish a new correction factor. Aligning reed tongues If the reed is silent or flat because the reed tongue is out of perfect alignment with the vent, you will have to re-center it. With the reed removed from the reed block and held up to a bright background, verify visually that the spaces between the reed tongue and the vent are equal on both sides of the tongue. This takes a bit of skill, because if you do not look precisely straight on, or if your viewing angles from either side of straight on are not exactly symmetrical, one gap may seem wider when it is really not. Sometimes it helps to rock the reed tongue down into the vent before sighting through the gap. Claudio Binci routinely centers his newly made reed tongues by this method, and when he finishes, the clearance on either side of the tongue is exactly .0015\u201d. Actually, the narrower the clearances, the easier it is to detect any asymmetry. The easiest way to re-center the tongue is to lever it back to the proper position. Insert a thin blade into the narrower space (midway along the tongue, so you can lift the tongue far enough to insert the blade, but not too close to the tip) and gently pry the reed tongue back to center. Take care not to twist the reed tongue or to damage the edge of the vent. If the reed tongue has worked its way off-center, it can only be because the rivet is too loose, so once you have it centered, you should reset the rivet, as described above, in \u201cCorrecting Errors and Newly Discovered Problems\u201d. Naturally, you must wax the reed back into the reed block when you are finished. Putting File to Metal Tuning is mostly about investigation, analysis, planning, organization, focus, and perspective, so it is appropriate that most of this tuning chapter has been dedicated to those critically important ingredients of tuning. However, that brings us to the remaining ingredients, which are skill, dexterity, and judgment, and this is where we finally put file to metal. Re-tuning in three stages - If you choose to re-tune, i.e., to alter the basic tuning by tuning to a different A, or to change a dry tuned accordion to wet (see the chapter on Tuning Musette Reeds), you should take the reeds out of the reed block for the first of three tuning stages. Re-tuning requires a lot of filing in the first stage, and adjacent reeds and leathers get in your way, making filing difficult. If you have a lot of filing to do, it is much easier to file a reed the same way the reed maker does, with the reed plate out of the reed block and lightly clamped in a vise, and with the leathers removed. The first tuning stage will be done with a file (except for the tiniest piccolo reeds), filing straight across the reed tongue (unless you are working on the tip, in which case you file directly toward or away from the rivet) to bring the reed to within a couple of cents of the final value. You need not obsess over small deviations at this stage, because the tuning will probably change anyway, perhaps by several cents, when you install the reed valves and wax the reed back into the reed block. You will not be able to compensate in advance for this change, because part of it is unpredictable. Sometimes the reed sharpens when mounted in the reed block and sometimes it flattens. Sometimes you get lucky and the change is very small or even zero. To check your progress during this first stage, place the reed directly over the aperture on the tuning table and draw air over the reed while managing your tuner. An assortment of different apertures will be required to fit the various reed sizes, so you must devise some way to fit those various apertures to your tuning bellows or tuning table. One way is to make a large opening in the top plate of your bellows and make an assortment of covers for this opening, each with a different sized aperture. One way to secure these covers is to slide them into slots cut around the top interior edge of three sides of a box mounted over the large aperture, as shown in the photo below. I\u2019m sure there are other ways, as well, but in any case, you should line your apertures with leather, fuzzy side up, to maintain a good air seal between the reed plate and the bellows. The second tuning stage is also done outside the accordion, but with the reeds mounted (waxed) into the reed block and with all reed valves (leathers) in place. The goal at this stage is to bring the tuning to within a cent or two of the desired final value. You will use a file this time, too, but this time file diagonally so as not to damage the leathers on adjacent reeds (you will probably ruin a few leathers anyway, so have some replacements on hand). It would be pointless to attempt this tuning stage without the leathers in place, because installing them later would change the tuning again, requiring an additional round of tuning. The third and final tuning stage must be done in the accordion because installing the reed block into the accordion changes the tuning yet again. However, understand that tuning in the accordion does not necessarily mean actually filing or scratching the reed tongue while the reed block is mounted in the accordion, although this is sometimes done. For our purposes, tuning in the accordion means measuring the tuning deviation with the reed block mounted in the accordion, then taking the reed block out to make the necessary correction. This is because every reed tongue must be supported while you file it, and the reed tongues facing into the reed block can best be supported from the inside of the reed block, which is most easily and reliably done with the reed block out of the accordion. In this final stage you will be eliminating small deviations on the order of a few cents at most, so you may be using a scratcher, rather than a file (especially on the smaller reeds). If the needed correction is a cent or more on the largest reeds, or more than a few cents on the smaller reeds, you can start with the file (except on the tiniest reeds, where files are too crude), but once you have it within a cent on the largest reeds and within a few cents on the smaller reeds, switch to a scratcher to avoid overshooting your tuning target. On the tiniest piccolo reeds, both the file and scratcher are too course and crude, and you will be better off using only fairly fine sand paper, perhaps around #220. See the chapter on Tuning Tiny Piccolo Reeds. Spot Tuning - If you choose not to alter the basic tuning of your accordion, and if you are just tuning a few reeds that are noticeably out of tune with the rest, you will have a much easier time of it because in most cases you will begin with the third tuning stage. If a few reeds are out of tune by more than you can comfortably correct with scratching or diagonal filing, you can take them out of the reed block individually (after establishing the needed correction, of course), rather than having to re-wax the entire reed block. Tuning with a file - Tuning with a file is a fairly aggressive tactic, and requires a good sense of touch and pressure, a good memory for how many cents of change results from any given amount of file pressure on the various reed sizes, and considerable finesse. Files remove lots of metal, so typically not much filing is required to bring a reed back into tune. Make one light stroke and see what difference that makes to the tuning, and based on that, estimate how many identical light strokes will be required to bring it in line with your tuning bellows target value. Not all strokes are equal. With practice, you will learn to tell by feel how much metal you have removed with each stroke. If the file skips lightly over the reed, offering little resistance, you obviously remove much less metal than if it seems to dig in and offer significant resistance. One heavy stroke can remove as much as many light strokes. Until you develop a good feel for this, check your results frequently, perhaps after each stroke, in order to avoid overshooting your target. When filing an exterior reed tongue to flatten its pitch, file in the bottom third of the reed tongue. Insert a reed lifter or metal feeler gauge under the reed tongue to support it while you file. Extend the reed lifter or feeler gauge out over the adjacent reed valve to protect it from your file. When filing the tip of either an exterior or interior reed tongue, file directly toward or away from the rivet. Slip a flat reed lifter under the tip to protect the reed plate and adjacent leathers. Take great care to file only the top surface, not the end or sides, as the clearance between the reed tongue and the sides and end of the vent is critical, and you must not do anything to enlarge it. In handmade reeds and hand fitted reeds, this clearance is only .0015, so even a very light file stroke could double it, essentially ruining the reed. The smaller the reed, the more vulnerable it is to this kind of damage. On the very smallest piccolo reeds, where the reed tongue may only be .002\u201d thick, you dare not use a file at all. In order to file the tip of an interior reed tongue, the tip of the tongue must be lifted up through the vent for access. This is done by inserting a small tool, wood, metal, or plastic, in through the opening in the bottom of the reed block and out through the tip of the vent. Then slip your flat reed lifter under the tip to support it evenly while you file. Be careful not to lever the reed plate out of the wax mounting during the process. This does not work on the smallest few clarinet reeds and on the top 20 or so piccolo reeds, because the tongue is too short to survive so much bending without suffering permanent damage. As a general rule, if the reed does not have leathers, it is probably too small to have its tongue lifted through the vent without permanently damaging it. In these cases, you can use a scratcher near the tip, taking special care to support the reed tongue evenly from below while you scratch. With this technique, you run the risk of cupping the end of the reed tongue due to excessive pressure and/or inadequate support from below. You also risk pushing burrs off the end of the reed tongue, where they will interfere with the tongue\u2019s passage through the vent, either silencing the reed or throwing it out of tune. If this happens, use the edge of your reed lifter or of a .004\u201d metal feeler gauge to scrape the tip clean. Alternatively, you can take the reed out of the reed block and tune it in your vise. The latter is by far the best course of action for the tiniest of reeds. One of your objectives while filing must be to avoid creating stress concentrations that could lead to cracks. This means don\u2019t cut a groove across the reed, not even a very shallow groove. Don\u2019t remove metal from one tiny area, or from just one edge of the reed tongue. The wider the area and the thinner the layer removed, the better. Your file must be perfectly parallel with the top surface of the reed tongue, so it removes metal equally across the entire width of the reed. The best tuning would be invisible, blending in perfectly with the reed makers original file marks. This degree of perfection is practically impossible to achieve, especially when filing diagonally across the reed tongue, but it is nevertheless a worthwhile goal to keep in mind. The less conspicuous your file marks, the better. Tuning with a scratcher \u2013 When you are so close to your tuning bellows target value that you think one more file stroke might cause an overshoot, switch to using a scratcher. This probably won\u2019t occur on the largest reeds, where it takes several light file strokes to make a cent of difference and where you are tuning to two or three cent accuracy, but on the smaller reeds, where you need more accuracy and where one file stroke can make several cents of difference, you will be using the scratcher often. Unless you choose to remove the reed from the reed block for tuning, you will also use a scratcher whenever flattening the tuning of the interior reed tongue, simply because you cannot get a file down into the vent. To flatten the pitch, use the scratcher to remove metal from the lower third of the reed tongue. If the cents change you need is more than you can get from a few scratches, remove the reed from the reed block so you can tune the originally filed side of it with a file. The number of cents change you can make with a scratcher varies with the size of the reed. On the largest reeds, you may only be able to get one cent or so without severely gouging the reed tongue, which is never a good idea. But on smaller reeds, you can use the scratcher to flatten the pitch by up to a several cents. To sharpen the pitch, you will use a file on the tip, after lifting the tip out of the vent for access. If the reed tongue is too small to lift out of the vent without permanently deforming it, then remove the reed from the reed block so you can scratch or file or sand the other side. Anytime you remove the reed from the reed block for tuning, establish a new tuning bellows base line for it by laying the reed directly on the opening in the top of the tuning bellows. Then apply your previously determined correction factor to get a new tuning bellows target value, which will be different from the tuning bellows target value you established for the reed mounted in the reed block. Tuning with a scratcher can be frustrating, because the changes in tuning you get are sometimes not those you expected, especially if your scratcher just moves metal around without actually removing it (see the discussion under \u201cmany pitfalls\u201d in the Tuning Dry Reeds section). Scratching lightly sometimes does not remove metal, but simply lays over (flattens down) the ridges left by the reed-maker\u2019s file. This is especially likely on handmade reeds, which are harder to scratch and which often exhibit more pronounced file marks. Laying over the file marks does not remove any weight, but it does shift the center of gravity in the direction the tool was traveling, and therefore impacts tuning, perhaps in the direction opposite to what the tuner intended if he was not aware of this subtle aspect of tuning. However, you can use this knowledge to your advantage in a way contrary to conventional wisdom by working any part of the reed tongue downward (i.e., toward the fixed end) to sharpen the pitch, and working any part of the reed tongue upward (i.e., toward the tip) to flatten the pitch. Thus you can, if you wish, sharpen the pitch by working with your scratcher on the lower third of the reed tongue, and flatten the pitch by working near the tip, exactly the opposite of the tuning procedure normally described. You just have to go lightly to be sure you are just laying the ridges over, rather than removing any metal. This technique is especially useful where you need to change the tuning only slightly, say one cent or less, in which case removing any metal at all can cause you to overshoot your target, especially on the smaller reeds. It is also a much gentler way of tuning that avoids the higher pressures that can, if you are not careful, bend or arch the reed tongue in a way that adversely impacts the voicing or otherwise increases air leakage between the reed tongue and the vent. Naturally, this technique works best for the outer reed tongues, on which you have good access to the filed side. On interior reed tongues, unless you remove the reeds from the reed block, you normally work on the unfiled blue side of the tongue, where there are no previous file marks to lay over, so to use this subtle technique you would have to work through the small opening in the bottom of the reed block, where it is very difficult to see what you are doing. Due to those difficulties, I don\u2019t normally try that. I scratch on the unfiled side unless I have taken the reed out of the reed block. Tuning with a Dremmel grinder - Some people tune with just a file and a scratcher, and maybe some fine sand paper, while some others prefer to use a Dremmel grinder. There is great controversy on this point, with some people even saying they would refuse to own an accordion that shows evidence of Dremmel tuning, because they believe the Dremmel grinder ruins the reeds. I have never seen any evidence that Dremmel grinding necessarily ruins reeds. The usual argument against it is that the Dremmel grinder removes too much metal. However, removing metal changes the tuning of the reed, so if too much metal had been removed, the reed would be out of tune. If the reed is in tune, that is strong evidence that exactly the right amount of metal has been removed. I have heard it claimed that if so much metal must be removed to bring it into tune, then the reed is no good anyway and should be replaced. However, I doubt that the person saying this has ever watched reed makers make reeds from scratch. They file very aggressively, removing copious amounts of metal. The amount of metal removed by a Dremmel grinder during a typical tuning is infinitesimally small in comparison. I have always tuned with just a file and a scratcher (and fine sandpaper for the tiniest reeds and for very small adjustments on some larger reeds) for the same reason that I always drill holes by hand. Power tools cut very quickly and it is easy to slip and drill or cut too far, and in an accordion, that can be especially damaging. Hand tools operate more slowly, and seem easier to control. However, I think Dremmel grinders offer certain advantages, and in the hands of a skilled operator, can probably be safe and effective. There is less pressure required, and thus less chance of bending the reed tongue or rotating it out of perfect alignment with the vent. The tiny grind stone is easier to maneuver in tight spaces than the relatively large and unwieldy tuning file, producing less chance of damaging the reed plate or adjacent leather. The high speed grinder removes metal evenly over a larger area, leaving a smoother, cleaner surface, free of scratches, gouges, file marks (stress concentrations that can lead to cracks), and free of the troubling burrs that can skew tuning results. In short, I think that while a Dremmel tool in the wrong hands can do a lot of damage, refusal to tolerate tuning with a Dremmel tool is probably rooted more in fear of change than in rational argument. I may experiment with a Dremmel on a junk accordion someday, to see if I can develop the skill, control, and confidence required to tune effectively with it. Here is a reed that was apparently tuned (flattened) with a Dremmel tool: This reed was tuned (flattened) with both a Dremmel tool and a file: This reed was sharpened by filing at the tip, and also flattened by scratching near the base: (Experienced eyes will detect that these are very old reeds, cut narrower at the base than modern reeds. In fact, these are from 1933.) Tuning tiny piccolo reeds It is not uncommon to find the highest piccolo reed tongues (generally between the highest C and the highest A) arched, cupped, twisted, or kinked by excessive force during tuning or voicing. The problems are that these reed tongues are so small that it is very difficult to see what you are doing when tuning or voicing them, and they are so fragile that the usual tuning tools are inappropriate for tuning them. The smallest tongues are only about .002\u201d thick near the free end. This is only 2/3 the thickness of a sheet of normal 20# copy paper, so they are very fragile. The teeth of a normal tuning file can catch an edge and tilt it upward, putting a twist in the reed tongue. The force necessary to make a scratch with a tuning scratcher can easily cup or arch the whole reed tongue if it is not very firmly and evenly supported from below. Lifting the reed tongue through the vent so it can be tuned from the outside would overstress it, permanently bending or arching the reed tongue. Attempts to lift or drop the tip to voice the reed can result in only the tip bending, rather than the whole tongue, as is required for proper voicing. Extreme care must be taken when tuning and voicing these reeds, or you will find yourself needing to buy new ones or to spend a lot of time straightening the old ones (see the chapter titled \u201cStraightening Piccolo Reeds). I tune these tiniest reeds with small pieces of #220 sandpaper glued to the ends of small wooden rods. If the interior reed tongue needs tuning, I remove the reed from the reed block so I can tune the filed side of the tongue. I support the tongue during sanding by sliding a .002\u201d metal feeler gauge under it, and for the very smallest ones, such as the one pictured, I use a .0015\u201d feeler gauge. I establish the tuning bellows base line and measure my progress toward the tuning bellows target value by placing the reed directly on my tuning bellows, rather than putting it back in the reed block each time. Only after I have reached my tuning bellows target value do I wax the reed back into the reed block and put it back in the accordion for a final check. Straightening tiny piccolo reeds If you need to straighten an arched, cupped, twisted, or kinked piccolo reed tongue, you will have to do it under fairly high magnification. The clearance under a properly voiced high A reed is about .0015\u201d (yes, that is 15/10,000 of an inch). It is impossible to see that tiny clearance without appropriate magnification. It is likewise impossible to see arches, waves or twists of that magnitude, yet the reed must be perfectly straight and flat so the tiny critical clearance can be maintained along most of its length. If it is arched or twisted so part of the tongue is higher than that, excessive air will leak between the tongue and the vent, and the reed will respond slowly or not at all. If any part (other than right at the fixed end near the rivet) is lower than that, it will choke. I use a 15x binocular microscope and work under a bright light put very close to the reed. I clamp an anvil (really just a paper clip bent to the appropriate shape) to the base of the microscope, with the end of the anvil extending horizontally into the field of view, and at the proper height to be in focus (the depth of focus at these magnifications is very shallow). I hold the reed plate in one hand, a small bending tool (tiny screwdriver) in the other. I use the anvil to support the reed tongue near where I want it to bend, and apply force with the bending tool to make the bend. I normally rest the shank of the bending tool on the edge of the reed vent and rock the tool into the reed tongue in order to minimize the possibility that the tool might slip toward the free end and cause only the tip of the reed tongue to bend. If I am removing a kink, I slide a narrow strip cut from a .0015\u201d metal feeler gauge under the reed tongue at the kink line to support it there while I press out the kink with either the bending tool or the anvil, or sometimes with both, one to hold the reed tongue firmly against the feeler gauge support, and the other to actually make the bend. To remove twists, I use two narrow strips cut from a .003\u201d metal feeler gauge clamped together to allow slipping the reed tongue endwise between them, and I twist with that. These are extraordinary measures. If you have a new reed in stock or can easily get one, it is cheaper to install a new reed than to spend a half hour straightening the old one. But if getting a new reed takes time and if the delay is intolerable, then you might choose to salvage the old one. It can be done with the proper tools and patience. Naturally, after any significant bending and stretching, the reed is likely to be out of tune, so you should expect to have to tune it. However, a new reed will have to be tuned, also, so time-wise, that might be a wash. Tools and supplies needed for tuning: Bellows pin pulling pliers Flat and phillips screwdrivers Tuning bellows Stroboscopic tuner, such as Peterson VS-II Virtual Strobe Tuner (about $300) or, if your accordion is tuned to A=440, and if you have an iPad or iPhone, you can use \"Strobe Tuner Pro\", an app for iPad and iPhone by Marcus Cavanaugh (about $3). Dirk's Tuner, a pc program available online as a download for $150, can listen to up to three reeds at a time and give you a report of the condition of each reed and the required corrections in either cents or hertz. (Caution: sometimes it hears only two of the three, and you can\u2019t always tell which one is missing, so you don\u2019t know which value is attributable to which reed.) Tuning file Tuning scratcher Reed lifter to support reed tongues and protect reed plates and leathers during tuning Reed wax Soldering iron modified for waxing (see article on waxing with a modified soldering iron) Reed leathers in all sizes Normally closed tweezers for handling leathers Sharp single edge razor blade for trimming leathers to proper length. Dull single edge razor blade for lifting and supporting the smallest reeds during tuning. Resin/alcohol glue (such as Indian Chief gasket shellac available at auto parts stores) for gluing leathers to reed plates. Naphtha or lighter fluid to remove spilled wax residue from reed plates and tongues. Soft cotton rag (with a small spot dampened with lighter fluid) for cleaning up spilled wax residue. Plastic, ironwood, aluminum, or brass scrapers for removing excess wax from reeds and reed blocks (avoid using steel scrapers on aluminum reed plates, as the relatively hard steel will scratch and damage the reed plates). Metal feeler gauges (for clearing stuck reeds, checking clearance between tongue and vent, and for supporting reeds while you file or scratch) A final caution Tuning can be a mind-numbing repetitive process. The chart of tuning data for all the reed tongues can be a blur of columns and numbers. It is very easy to become bored, fatigued, distracted, absent minded, and careless while tuning, and this all too easily leads to mistakes. Here are some tips to help you stay organized and focused. 1) Mark note values (note names) on the reeds or on the reed block or on a piece of tape attached to the reed block to help prevent tuning the wrong reed. Verify that your tuner indicates the correct name of the note you are tuning. 2) Mark the name of the reed set (bassoon white, bassoon black, etc.) on each side of the reed block to help avoid inadvertently tuning a reed in the wrong set. 3) Use worksheets or charts to keep tuning data organized. Make a separate worksheet for each reed set and label it clearly. 4) Make worksheets illustrate the process and numbers used to arrive at the tuning target for each reed in order to facilitate double checking all calculations. 5) Highlight or color code all chart data relating to inner reed tongues to help distinguish them from data relating to outer reed tongues. 6) Use plus signs on all correction factors for reed tongues that need to be sharpened and use minus signs on all correction factors for reed tongues that need to be flattened. 7) Circle each reed tongue's tuning target value as you finish tuning that tongue, in order to reduce the likelihood of inadvertently using that target value again for some other reed. 8) Worksheets should show the initial tuning bellows reading for each reed tongue alongside the tuning bellows target value to facilitate keeping track of progress toward the target value in order to better judge how much additional filing or scratching will be required. This will help avoid overshoots. 9) Be cautious and alert for errors. Double check all calculations. If a target tuning value does not seem right, that is, if it is very different from the target values for neighboring reeds, then double check everything before putting file to metal. It is far easier, and far less disheartening, to correct mistakes on paper than on the reeds themselves. The full explanation of the formula for determining cents per bps for each note. An understanding of exactly how cents relate to hertz (hz), why each cent equates to more hertz at the higher notes, and how to calculate the exact number of hertz that equates to each cent for any note, begins with an understanding of our 12 note equal temperament chromatic scale and the fact that with each octave, the frequency in terms of hertz doubles. At piano A1 the frequency is 55 hz. An octave higher at A2, the frequency is 110 hz, at A3 it is 220 hz, at A4 it is 440 hz, at A5 it is 880 hz, at A6 it is 1760 hz, and at A7 it is 3520 hz. Clearly, each of the 12 equal semitone intervals in any higher octave is spread over a greater number of hertz than its counterpart in any lower octave. Since each semitone interval occupies a greater range of hertz in the higher octave, it follows that each cent (1/100 of a semitone) also occupies a greater range of hertz in the higher octave. We label basic tunings in terms of the note A (A=440, etc.) because only the A notes in our scales have integers (whole numbers) as their frequencies. All the other 11 note frequencies in each octave are then derived from the frequency of the A according to a specific mathematical formula that divides each octave into 12 equal pitch intervals. This formula is exponential, rather than linear, because our perception of pitch is not linearly related to frequency. The relationship between frequency and our sense of pitch is exponential (a linear relationship would imply that each successive octave interval would occupy the same number of hertz, rather than doubling each time). This holds true within each octave, as well. That means we cannot simply divide each octave into 12 equal numbers of hertz, but must instead assign each successively higher note within the octave a greater range of hertz than its predecessor, or the intervals would not sound equal. The formula that does this perfectly is an exponential formula based on the fact that 2 raised to the 1/12 power multiplied by itself 12 times = 2. That is, 21/12 21/12 21/12 21/12 21/12 21/12 21/12 21/12 21/12 21/12 21/12 21/12 = 2(1/12+1/12+1/12+1/12+1/12+1/12+1/12+1/12+1/12+1/12+1/12+1/12) = 21 = 2 By assigning each successive note on the chromatic scale a frequency equal to the frequency of the preceding note x 2 raised to the 1/12 power, after 12 successive notes we arrive at a frequency equal to 2 times the original note. In other words, this formula doubles the frequency at each octave, while making each semitone pitch interval sound equally spaced. Here is the formula applied to calculate the frequencies of each note in the octave immediately above A4: A# = 440 x 21/12 = 440 1.059463094 = 466.1637614 B = A# x 21/12 = A 22/12 = 440 1.122462048 = 493.8833013 C = B x 21/12 = A 23/12 = 440 1.189207115 = 523.2511306 C# = C 21/12 = A 24/12 = A 21/3 = 440 1.25992105 = 554.3652619 D = D# = E = F = F# = G = G# = A 2 11/12 = 440 1.887748624 = 830.6093947 A = G# 2 1/12 = A 2 12/12 = A 2 1 = 440 2= 880 Hertz Just as each successive semitone interval within an octave spans a greater range of hertz as we ascend the scale, so does each cent interval within any semitone span a greater range of hertz as we ascend through 100 cents to get to the next note in the scale. Thus, the difference in terms of hertz between A4 and a tone one cent sharper than A4 is less than the difference in hertz between the two tones 25 cents and 26 cents sharper than A4. The formula that expresses this relationship perfectly is very similar to the one used for assigning frequencies to notes within an octave, and is based on the fact that 2 raised to the 1/1200 power multiplied by itself 100 times = 2 raised to the 1/12 power. In other words, 100 cents = 2100/1200 = 2 1/12 = 1.059463094. So +100 cents from note A becomes A# = 440 x 2 1/12 = 440 1.059463094 = 466.163761 hz. Thus, advancing 1 cent at a time for 100 cents (i.e., a semitone) brings us exactly to the next note in the scale. This formula provides that a tone x cents sharper than any given tone has a frequency equal to that of the given tone multiplied by 2 raised to the x/1200 power. For example, the frequency of a tone 1 cent sharper than A4 is 440 x 2 raised to the 1/1200 power. Similarly, the frequency of a tone 5 cents sharper than A4 has the frequency 440 x 2 raised to the 5/1200 power. Thus, the frequency of a tone 100 cents higher than A4 is 440 x 2 raised to the 100/1200 power, which is the same as 440 x 2 raised to the 1/12 power, which is the formula for the frequency of the next note up the scale, A#. Here is the formula applied to calculate frequencies for some tones various numbers of cents sharper than A4: 1 cent = 21/1200 = 1.000577790. So +1 cents from note A = 440.2542276 hertz 5 cents = 25/1200 = 1.002892288. So +5 cents from note A = 441.2726067 10 cents = 210/1200 = 1.005792941. So +10 cents from note A = 442.548894 15 cents = 215/1200 = 1.008701984. So +15 cents from note A = 443.8288728 To calculate frequencies of tones various numbers of cents flatter than A4, we take the reciprocal. In other words, -1 cent = 1/cent = 1/21/1200 =1/1.000577790 = 0.999422433, so -1 cent from note A = 439.000577567 -5 cents = 1/25/1200 = 1/1.002892288 = 0.997116053. So -5 cents from note A = 438.7310634 -10 cents = 1/210/1200 = 1/1.005792941. So -10 cents from note A = 437.4657865 -15 cents = 1/215/1200 = 1/1.008701984. So -15 cents from note A = 436.2041584 Notice that the number of hertz equating to -5 cents (-1.2883 hz) is not exactly equal to the number of hertz equating to +5 cents (+1.2726 hz), but they are so close (within .0157 hz) that no one would ever hear the difference, not even on musette tuning at the highest notes. That is why it is okay to use the simplified \"cheat sheet\", which uses a single conversion factor for tuning either sharp or flat. No one can hear a .0157 bps difference in beat frequency. Now you know how to calculate the difference in hertz between two notes any given number of cents apart. Since each hertz of difference generates 1 beat per second (bps) when the two notes are played together, you now also know the number of bps that is generated for any given number of cents difference. A very clear, plain language explanation of why each hertz of difference generates one bps can be found in Chapter 27 of PIANO ACCORDION OWNER\u2019S MANUAL AND BUYER\u2019S GUIDE.","title":"Accordion Repair 3"},{"location":"accordion-repair3/#background-information","text":"Why is there so little information available about repairing and tuning accordions? Why haven't experienced repairpersons and tuners shared what they know? Could it be because they want to guard the source of their livelihood? Could it be because they think repairing and tuning accordions is a trade that must be learned over a lifetime or through an old world style apprenticeship under expert supervision, and that sharing a little knowledge with novices would only get people into trouble? Could it be that even though they are good at repairing and tuning, they are not so good at communicating what they know? Could it be simply that there are so few of them and so few of us that they seldom meet anyone who wants to know what they know? If so, then they may sense that the market for their knowledge is so limited that it is simply not worth the time and expense to put what they know into a cohesive, coherent, communicable format. It seems to me that all of these reasons are valid, and that with so many good reasons for the existing information void, it could continue indefinitely if I don't do something about it. So I plan to fill that void, first with this website and later with a another book, which I am currently calling PIANO ACCORDION REPAIR MANUAL AND TUNING GUIDE. The information posted on this website will endure only as long as I continue living and paying the rent on the website server. When that ends, it will all disappear with a click of the server owner's mouse unless I put it into a more lasting format; hence the book idea. I don't expect the book to be a big seller volume-wise, because it will serve only this very tiny niche market that you and I occupy, but to make it even remotely possible that I will be able to recoup the expense of publishing it, I am reserving all copy rights to all the material posted here. Please use the information you find here to educate yourself and to rescue as many old accordions as possible, but do not duplicate any of it for commercial purposes. Thank you for your consideration. I am not a master accordion repairer/tuner. I have had no formal education or apprenticeship in repairing and tuning. I'm quite certain that I do not know everything there is to know about repairing and tuning accordions. I have learned some things about repairing and tuning by reading what others have written, but unfortunately, until now there has been very little available. I have learned primarily by experimenting, and that means often making mistakes and correcting them. I have made many mistakes and I have learned enough from correcting them that I am now quite comfortable doing most repairs and tuning dry and light musette (LMM and LMMH) accordions. However, I am just beginning to learn about tuning full musette (LMMM and LMMMH) accordions. Even though it is still very much a work in progress, I think writing down what I have learned so far may be of value to others taking a similar path. It also provides an opportunity for those who know more about tuning than I to critique what I have written, should they be so generous as to do so. The internet provides a wonderful forum for disseminating information, and for discussing and revising that information. It puts all our heads together, and provides unprecedented opportunities for learning from each other. I have learned much about repairing and tuning accordions by doing it. I learned some more by organizing what I have learned into what I hope is a cohesive, coherent, communicable format, presented here. Since publishing this website I have learned still more from several of my readers who have shared their knowledge and experience. I hope to continue learning by hearing other people's reactions to what I have written. If you see some way to improve or expand upon on what I have written, then I am eager to hear what you have to say.","title":"Background information"},{"location":"accordion-repair3/#accordion-tuning-overview","text":"Reeds go out of tune for many reasons, and filing the reed is not always the best remedy. It is best to understand why each reed is out of tune before trying to correct its tuning by filing or scratching the reed tongue. Always look for clues that might indicate the cause of the problem and correct any such problem before tuning. Tune the reed only as a last resort. If you tune first, and correct the original problem later, the reed will once again be out of tune because of the filing or scratching you did. Dirt - For instance, dirt and grime add weight to the reed tongue, throwing it out of tune. Dirt can also increase friction and drag. Cleaning a dirty reed will often put it back in tune, or at least closer to it, so whether or not you see any dirt, wax, or grime on the reed tongue, clean it thoroughly before attempting any tuning (but not before you establish your tuning bellows base reading and tuning bellows target for that reed). See the chapter on cleaning reeds and the chapter on using the tuning bellows. Rust - Rust on the reed tongue throws it out of tune by adding weight to it (iron oxide is heavier than iron). You should brush off all the rust using one of the small brass wire brushes described and shown below. However, after the rust is removed the reed will still be out of tune because it will now be lighter, due to the loss of the iron bound up in the iron oxide). Whenever rust is involved, cleaning, then filing the reed is the only way to get it back in tune. See the chapter on Putting File to Metal. Cracks - Metal fatigue cracks throw reeds out of tune, and filing will not help, at least not for long, because the crack will continue to develop, throwing the reed farther out of tune as it develops. Discard any cracked reed. Loose rivet - If the steel rivet (sometimes a screw) holding the reed tongue to the reed plate is not extremely tight, more of the reed tongue can lift off the reed plate as the tongue swings, effectively increasing the length of the tongue, thereby flattening the pitch. If a reed is difficult to tune because its frequency wanders more than that of its neighbours in response to changes in bellows pressure, try resetting the rivet before tuning. Misalignment \u2013 A loose rivet can also allow the reed tongue to drift out of perfect alignment with the vent. Misalignment of the reed tongue in the vent will usually silence the reed, but slight misalignment can sometimes allow it to keep working, while causing a metallic ringing noise as the tongue brushes lightly against the side of the vent on each oscillation. The friction caused by this metal on metal contact slows the reed significantly, throwing it out of tune. Very slight misalignment can cause the reed to go flat without making any ringing noise. The best remedy in all these cases is to correct the misalignment. See the chapter on Aligning Reed Tongues. Bad Leathers - A stiff, curled, loose, or missing leather can throw a reed out of tune by up to ten cents or more. Surprisingly, until you think it through, the reed tongue that is thrown out of tune is often the one alongside the defective leather, rather than the one under it. The best remedy is to replace the leather. New leathers - A new leather anchored differently than the original (glued along more or less of its length than before) can also throw a reed out of tune (this time the one under it), by up to five cents or more. The easiest and surest way to correct this (once you have replaced the leather and rechecked the tuning in the accordion in order to determine the actual tuning error with the new leather) is to retune the reed with a scratcher or a file. Cracked wax - Cracked wax can throw a reed out of tune by allowing the reed plate to vibrate relative to the reed block (rather than transferring all its vibration energy into the reed block). This usually also causes a significant decrease in volume relative to neighbouring reeds, and often creates a buzzing sound, but sometimes, in the early stages, the only symptom is the reed being out of tune on the flat side. If you scratch or file such a reed to tune it, your victory will be temporary at best, because the reed will continue vibrating itself loose, going farther out of tune until it finally goes silent and falls out. Then when you wax it back in, it will be out of tune because of all the filing you did. Especially if both tongues on the same reed plate are sounding flat, check for cracked wax by pressing the reed plate against the reed block with your thumbnail while the reed is sounding on your test bellows. If the finger pressure causes the reed pitch to sharpen, you will know that the wax has separated from the reed plate, allowing the reed plate to vibrate around the reed tongue. In this case, remove the reed from the reed block, clean all the old wax off the reed and off the reed block, and wax the reed back in with fresh reed wax. Then put the reed block back into the accordion and check the tuning again. A change in the weather - Changes in temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure all impact air density, which is one of the factors determining the frequency at which reed tongues vibrate. Changes in air density affect all the reeds in a similar manner, though, so if all the reeds were tuned under approximately the same atmospheric conditions, the accordion should at least remain in tune with itself as atmospheric conditions change. However, if the tuning job is not completed under the same atmospheric conditions under which it was begun, the reeds tuned under one set of conditions will not be exactly in tune with those tuned under different conditions. For instance, a 20 degree Fahrenheit change in temperature can change the tuning of a reed by 2 or 3 cents. Microphones, plugs, etc. \u2013 Anything installed on top of a reed block that hangs over the edge impinges on the reed tongue\u2019s environment. The reed responds to changes in its surroundings by changing its frequency. This can easily be demonstrated by hanging your thumb over the edge of a reed block right over a reed you are sounding on your test bellows. With your tuner turned on, you can observe the change in tuning as you move your thumb into and back out of the reed tongue\u2019s immediate vicinity. Installation of microphone systems after the accordion has been tuned often result in one or more reeds going out of tune. You will have to decide whether to relocate any such obstacle or to tune the affected reeds to compensate for the obstacle\u2019s presence. Register slides out of alignment - If the register slide is not in the fully open position, the reeds along that bank of reeds can be out of tune. In that case, moving the slide to the full open position will put them back in tune. Normal wear \u2013 Sometimes no reason can be found, in which case we conclude that the reed has gone out of tune as a result of normal wear. This is a cop-out, of course, because there is always a reason, perhaps as simple as the wax being harder than it was at the last tuning, but if we cannot find and correct any of the above problems, we have no choice but to tune the reed. Note that tuning by scratching and/or filing would be helpful only in three or four of the cases described above (rust, new leather, normal wear, and possibly microphones or plugs mounted to the reed block). In all the other cases, scratching or filing before solving the underlying problem would actually be counter-productive, so investigate before you file, and remedy any problems prior to tuning.","title":"Accordion tuning overview"},{"location":"accordion-repair3/#spot-tuning","text":"Tuning a few problem reeds without re-tuning the whole accordion is called spot tuning. In this case, the amount of filing is usually minimal, if any, and most of the tuning is done with a scratcher. It is far less work than a total re-tuning, because the reeds are generally left in the reed block while you tune. If just a few reeds are out of tune by more than you can comfortably correct with scratching or diagonal filing, you can take them out of the reed block individually (after determining the magnitude and direction of the correction needed), tune them to within a few cents, then wax them back in for their final tuning. That\u2019s a lot easier than re-waxing the entire reed block.","title":"Spot Tuning"},{"location":"accordion-repair3/#re-tuning","text":"Re-tuning, i.e., altering the basic tuning by tuning all the reeds to a different A, or changing a dry tuned accordion to wet (see the chapter on Tuning Musette Reeds), is a much bigger job than spot tuning, as many more reeds are involved and you will probably have to take the reeds out of the reed block for the first stage of tuning. Re-tuning requires a lot of filing in the first stage, and while mounted in the reed block, adjacent reeds and leathers get in your way, making filing difficult. If you have a lot of filing to do, it is much easier to file a reed the same way the reed maker does, with the reed plate out of the reed block and firmly clamped in a vise, with the leathers removed. See \u201cPutting File to Metal\u201d for more details on the mechanics of tuning.","title":"Re-tuning"},{"location":"accordion-repair3/#setting-reasonable-standards-of-accuracy","text":"Don\u2019t be too obsessed with accuracy -_ Whatever the nature of your tuning project, don\u2019t waste time by tuning to greater accuracy than is needed. Electronic tuners are accurate to within 1/10 of a cent, but trying to tune all the reeds in an accordion to this degree of accuracy is a fool's errand for at least four reasons. First, most human ears cannot detect pitch differences smaller than about three cents, so especially on the lower notes there is little reason to exceed that level of accuracy. Second, the tuning of a reed varies from day to day by up to a few cents due to changes in temperature, atmospheric pressure, and humidity (all factors impacting air density). You can spend a lot of time meticulously tuning only to discover the next day (or even later the same day) that all the frequencies are off again. Third, some reeds can vary by a cent or more depending on how long they play. A reed may start out sharp and slightly flatten after sounding for a second or two, in which case there is no rational basis for choosing one condition over the other as a basis for your tuning (do you want your whole notes in perfect tune, or your quarter notes?). Fourth, the frequency of the reed varies with the volume (bellows pressure) because it flexes closer to the rivet as it makes wider swings in response to greater air flow. This brings more of its length into play, lowering its pitch. It is very difficult to tune every reed at exactly the same volume level, or even to check the tuning of the same reed at exactly the same volume twice in a row, so even if you meticulously tune with great precision, you will find it difficult to duplicate or verify your results, even just a minute later. For a partial solution to this problem, see the chapter on Tuning With a Manometer, but the fact remains that extreme accuracy is nearly impossible and not necessary, except in the case of the highest notes in your musette reed set. See the chapter on Tuning Musette Reeds. But don\u2019t be careless, either, as there are other factors to consider which may make accuracy more desirable. First, even though the instrument's absolute tuning will vary from day to day and at different volume levels, the various reeds in it will be influenced by the same external factors and will respond in very similar ways, thus keeping them more or less in tune with each other. So even though under certain conditions the accordion may be slightly out of tune with your electronic tuner or even with other instruments, it will be in tune with itself, which is the most important thing. Second, even though we cannot hear the difference between two pitches two cents apart played sequentially, we can hear the harmonics and possibly the beat created when they are played together, and this contributes significantly to the quality of the sound. Similarly, the natural harmonics and beats created by certain intervals and chords may vary enough to be noticeable to some people with well trained ears (especially at the higher pitches) even though the individual notes may not be perceptibly out of tune. At the lower pitches these harmonics are much less audible and much less sensitive to small tuning errors. Set reasonable standards of accuracy - For these reasons, if I am tuning an entire instrument, I tune dry reeds to within one cent at the highest pitches, to within three cents at the lowest pitches, and to within 2 cents near the middle of the accordion's range. If I am spot tuning, I tune to within one or two cents of the average of several neighboring reeds. After all, the whole accordion may be slightly out of pitch on the day I am spot tuning due to the factors listed above, in which case if I tune one reed to exact pitch as indicated by my electronic tuner, that reed may be out of tune with the rest of the instrument. It makes far more sense to check other reeds nearby, eliminate the outliers, and take an average of the rest. Then tune the subject reed and the outliers to within one or two cents of that average. Accuracy is most important in musette tuning - Note that the above standards apply only to dry reeds. You will find that when tuning musette reeds, a tuning error of a couple of tenths of a cent can make a noticeable difference at the higher pitches. However, in that case you are usually tuning to the beat, rather than to an absolute note value. When tuning to the beat, all that matters is the difference in pitch between the two reeds. This difference can be controlled with great precision because both reeds are sounding together, are operating under identical atmospheric conditions, and are responding to the exact same bellows pressure. Even if atmospheric conditions and/or bellows pressure are different next time, causing both notes to be sharper or flatter, they will both be impacted in approximately the same way. The difference between their frequencies will remain pretty stable, and so will the beat, which is all that matters when you tune to the beat. See the chapter on Tuning Musette Reeds.","title":"Setting reasonable standards of accuracy"},{"location":"accordion-repair3/#the-real-essence-of-tuning-investigation-analysis-and-planning","text":"While it is true that tuning accordion reeds involves removing metal from the reed tongues (see the chapter on Putting File to Metal), the real essence of tuning lies in investigation, analysis, and planning. Whether tuning an entire accordion or merely spot tuning a few problem notes, before putting file to metal it is absolutely essential to develop and adhere to a tuning plan that tells you how much to change the tuning of each reed tongue and in which direction. Investigation A=440? - The first step of your investigation is to learn or decide whether this is or will be an A440 accordion or whether it is or will be tuned to some other value for A. An A440 accordion has the A above middle C (the second A up in the clarinet reed set) tuned to 440 hertz, and all other notes follow from that. You will find accordions tuned to A440, A441, and A442, as well as other values. I found one 1933 model tuned to A446. The easiest way to determine which value of A forms the basis of your accordion\u2019s original tuning plan is to use a strobe tuner or \"virtual\" strobe tuner to examine a few of its bassoon reeds or bass reeds to find which A setting gives you an indication of zero cents deviation, or at least the smallest average deviation. Naturally, this investigation must be done with the reeds still mounted in the accordion, because they will vibrate at different frequencies once you take them out of the accordion. You should choose to investigate the bass reeds or the bassoon (L) reeds because they are always straight tuned, whereas one or more sets of your clarinet (M) reeds may be wet tuned, which would give you a misleading result. Piccolo (H) reeds, can also be checked, but being smaller, they are more vulnerable to being out of tune due to an accumulation of dirt and grime, which could also give you a misleading or ambiguous result. You can tune your accordion to any A you want, but discovering and adhering to the original basic tuning is a much easier task than switching to a different value of A. Adhering to the original tuning plan will require much less filing on fewer reeds, and you will probably be able to do it without removing the reeds from the reed blocks. Wet? Or dry? - The second step of your investigation is to determine whether the accordion is wet or dry tuned. That is, does it have more than one set of M reeds, and if so, is one or more of those sets tuned slightly off-pitch to create a tremolo effect (wet tuning, often called musette tuning) when both (or all three) sets play? (For clear instructions on how to identify your accordion\u2019s reed configuration, see Chapters 4, 5, and 8 of PIANO ACCORDION OWNER\u2019S MANUAL AND BUYER\u2019S GUIDE, available on the \"Owner's Manual\" page). If you have two M sets, to determine if it is wet tuned you simply listen for the tremolo. If your ear is not already trained to recognize tremolo, then set your treble switches to play just one M set. Play a single note and while sustaining that note hit the switch that allows just one other M set to play that note along with the first. If you suddenly hear tremolo, it means one of those reeds is slightly out of tune. If you hear tremolo on nearly all notes when both M reeds for those notes sound, the detuning is probably intentional, meaning you probably have Musette tuning. If you hear tremolo on just a few, you probably have a dry tuned accordion in which those few reeds are out of tune. If you hear tremolo when just one clarinet reed is played along with a corresponding bassoon or piccolo reed, then one of those reeds is definitely out of tune. If you have three M reed sets, then you certainly have musette tuning. Use your strobe tuner to identify which set is supposed to be on concert pitch (I call that the clarinet reed set), which set is tuned sharp, and which set is tuned flat (I call these detuned reeds the musette reed sets). In some LMMM and LMMMH accordions both musette sets are tuned sharp, with one being sharper than the other, in which case you will discover this during your investigation. If you have an A440 accordion and an iPhone or an iPad, you can more conveniently investigate all this by using the \"Strobe Tuner Pro\" app from Marcus Cavanaugh, inc. ($2.99 at the iPad App Store). Once you have identified which reed sets are which, label the reed blocks accordingly for future reference. I label each row on each reed block: \u201cbassoon white\u201d, \u201cbassoon black\u201d, \u201cclarinet white\u201d, \u201cclarinet black\u201d, \u201cmusette white\u201d, \u201cmusette black\u201d, etc. (remember, each reed set is divided approximately in half, with each half mounted on a different reed block). Analysis and Planning If you have a dry tuned accordion and wish it to remain dry, there is relatively little analysis and planning to do. You will simply plan to tune all reeds including bass reeds to concert pitch, based on the A (440, 442, etc.) of your choice. If you adhere to the original basic tuning, you will probably not tune every reed, but rather just those that are out of tune by some minimum amount, such as 2 cents or 3 cents or more, especially for the lower notes. See the chapter on tuning dry reeds. If you have a musette accordion (or if you are converting your dry tuned LMMH accordion to musette, the first step in your tuning plan will be to tune all the dry reeds (the bass, bassoon, clarinet, and piccolo reed sets) to concert pitch (based on the proper A for your accordion). But the second and more interesting step is to develop a tuning plan for your musette reeds. Before tuning any musette reeds, you must first arrive at a musette tuning plan that achieves the tremolo beat progression you want to create. If you are merely spot tuning to correct a few bad sounding notes, then you will want to analyze and understand your accordion\u2019s original musette tuning plan (beat progression), so you can tune those few problem reeds to fit the current plan. But if you are tuning the whole instrument, your goal may be to alter its tuning plan/beat progression to one that sounds better to you. Many possible tuning plans - For LMM and LMMH accordions, establishing a tuning plan begins with deciding what beat progression you want. For instance, do you want to hear one beat per second (bps) on the lowest F, with the beat frequency gradually and steadily increasing as you ascend the 41 note harmonic scale to four bps on the highest A? Do you prefer to hear two bps on the lowest F, progressing to eight bps at the highest A? Maybe one bps progressing to six bps is more to your liking, or two to four, or some other progression. Although my American ear does not appreciate tunings wetter than these, in some parts of the world some people claim to like tunings as wild as 4.5 bps at the low F and as much as 30 bps at the high A. Thierry Benetoux, in THE INS AND OUTS OF THE ACCORDION, briefly describes four different beat progression curves, running four full octaves from the D# below our lowest F (which I will call F1) to the D# above our highest A (which I will call A4 (because it is the fourth A on our 41 key keyboard). Mnsr. Benetoux describes his vibrato beats in terms of beats per minute, but if we divide his numbers by 60 to convert to beats per second, and if we plot out his curves, then truncate them to fit our 41 key piano accordion keyboards, we come up with these four curves: \"American att.\" runs from 0.7 bps at F1 to 3.5 bps at A4. \"American\" runs from 0.9 bps at F1 to 4.2 bps at A4. \"Light musette\" runs from 1.6 bps at F1 to 5.3 bps at A4. \"Musette\" runs from 2.2 bps at F1 to 7 bps at A4. Although Mnsr. Benetoux has drawn simple straight lines to represent each of his curves, none of his curves are actually simple straight lines. If you plot them on graph paper with the 41 key scale across the bottom, you can readily see that they all have an inflection point somewhere in the first half of the keyboard, after which the curve rises more steeply. One way to come a bit closer to these curves is to create a linear progression of cents deviation between successive notes, rather than a linear progression of beat frequency. That is, make the incremental decrease in cents deviation between any two adjacent notes be constant, rather than making the incremental increase in beat frequency be constant. The result is very similar, except that a little less of the increase in beat frequency occurs in the lower half of the keyboard and a little more of it occurs farther up the scale. The increase in beat frequency as you advance pitch-wise up the keyboard is still very smooth and the beat frequency increase between any two adjacent notes is still barely perceptible, if at all, but the overall sound of the accordion will be slightly different because the beats will all be a bit slower near the middle of the keyboard than they would have been if you had used a linear beat progression. For LMMM and LMMMH accordions (called \u201cfull musette\u201d accordions), you must not only decide on a desired beat progression for each of the two musette sets paired individually with the dry clarinet set, but you must also consider the beat progression that will result when all three are played together. I don\u2019t yet know how to predict that beat progression, so I can offer you little guidance on this, other than to suggest that you analyse the beat progressions of the individual pairs in a similar accordion whose tuning you like and duplicate that in your own accordion. The main point is that there are a very large number of different tuning curves (beat progressions) possible, and the one that is right for you depends on your personal taste. Whatever your choice, you must then establish the desired beat frequency for each note in between. You might want a nice linear progression, with the beat increasing by the exact same amount between any two successive notes on the scale, or you might want to increase the beat slowly through the first octave or so, then increase it more rapidly the rest of the way up the keyboard. Another possibility is to increase the beat to some maximum near the middle of the keyboard and keep the beat frequency constant from there on up. The only hard and fast rule is to avoid abrupt changes. No note should beat at a significantly different frequency from its immediate neighbors. If you are not yet sure what you want, then before tuning your accordion to a new beat progression, you should listen to many accordions, analyze the beat progression of one you particularly like, and duplicate that tuning on your own accordion. For a quick comparison of several different beat progressions, visit the Fisitalia website and play the short recordings of the six different tunings they offer. Unfortunately, they don't precisely define the full beat progression of each tuning, and the notes played for comparison are only through a one octave C chord near the low frequency end of the keyboard, but you can easily tell the difference, learn to count the beats, see for yourself how the beat frequency increases as you advance up the scale, and perhaps decide which tuning sounds best to you. However, keep in mind that their recordings do not reveal the tunings at the high end of the keyboard, where the beats would be faster, and where really fast beats can sound really awful. Here is the link . Analyzing beat progressions - One way to analyze a beat progression is to compare the beat on each note to a metronome beat. Several digital metronomes are available as free downloads. I use an iPad app called Epic Metronome. I like it because it has a moving graphic presentation of an old fashioned mechanical metronome arm swinging back and forth across the screen, and that visual representation is easy for me to monitor while I\u2019m counting the musette beat. I set the metronome for 30 beats per minute, then I count the beat during two full swings of the arm, which is four seconds. I divide that count by four to get the beat frequency to the nearest quarter beat per second (bps). If you have not yet trained your ear to count the beats, you might start by singing silently along with them, la-la-la-la-la-la, matching each \"la\" to one of the beats. For faster beats, it helps to think in terms of pairs, triplets, and quadruplets of \"la\". For instance, while you might not be able to count ten individual \"la\"s per second, you might be able to count two quadruplets and a pair. With this technique, I can count with confidence up to about 12 bps, which to my taste is beyond the desirable range. By counting the tremolo beat for each note, you can accurately plot the tuning curve for any light musette accordion (LMM or LMMH). As you plot the beats for each note, you are likely to find some deviations from a smooth curve. If you assume these deviations are caused by specific notes being a little out of tune, you can ignore them in order to plot a smooth curve (or a straight line) as a model for tuning your other accordions. However, for some of the wider tunings that you might encounter in some full musette (MMM, LMMM or LMMMH) accordions, you might not be able to count the beat near the upper end of the keyboard range, because it is too fast. In this case, unless you can hear the beat in terms of its pitch as an overtone (can anyone do this? I don't know!), you will have to revert to tuning those notes entirely in terms of cents. BPS versus cents - Although I think it is most informative to speak of musette tuning (at least light musette tuning) in terms of beat, most people still speak of it in terms of cents. For instance, I once saw a list that showed American musette as 10 cents sharp, Italian musette as 15 cents sharp, French musette as 20 cents sharp, Irish as 25 cents sharp, etc. I have seen some sources suggest tunings as wild as 32 cents sharp. Aside from the fact that these wider tunings would sound awful to me, I think their descriptions are misleading, because they seem to suggest that the entire range of notes should all be tuned to the same cents deviation, which is never the case. Sometimes the given number refers to the deviation at the low F on our keyboards, and sometimes it refers to the deviation at A=440. But it never refers to the deviation at the highest A. Regardless of the cents of deviation used at the low end of the keyboard, the deviation is always reduced as we progress up the scale. If it were not, few of us would like the sound. Tuning the high end or even the middle of the keyboard of an LMM or LMMH accordion to large deviations creates a beat so fast that to most American ears it sounds more like fingernails on a blackboard than a beat, and it definitely grates on our nerves. (In MMM, LMMM, and LMMMH accordions, it is said that the presence of the third reed makes the wider tunings tolerable. I plan to do some experimenting on this in the near future as I develop tuning plans for my LMMM acordions.) Regardless of the amount of deviation, or of the differences among our individual tastes, we don\u2019t hear the cents, we hear the beat. The beat frequency is extremely important to the quality of the sound. When tuning musette reeds, we most often tune them to the beat, rather than to some nominal number of cents sharp or flat. Our tuning plan is based on a desired beat progression. What we hear and what we really seek to control is the tremolo beat frequency measured in beats per second. It therefore makes much more sense to describe musette tuning (at least light musette tuning) in terms of beat, rather than cents, and to specify how the beat changes as we progress up the keyboard. Understanding the relationship between hertz, bps and cents - The problem with this approach is that our tuning equipment is calibrated in cents, (one cent equals 1/100 of a semitone), so to be able to use our tuners to achieve a desired beat, we must also understand the exact relationship between cents and beats per second. Unfortunately, that relationship is different for each note. Generally, one cent of difference in pitch has less impact on the beat frequency at the lower notes and more impact at the higher notes. This is because the beat frequency is exactly equal to the difference between the two note frequencies expressed in hertz, and because each cent represents more hertz at the higher notes. For instance, at the lowest clarinet F on our keyboard (174.6 hertz), each hertz of difference (bps) equates to about 10 cents. Near A=220 hertz, each hertz equates to about 8 cents, at A=440 hertz, about 4 cents, at A=880 hertz, about 2 cents, and at the highest clarinet A on our keyboards (A=1760 hertz), each hertz is only about 1 cent (for a more complete discussion of why this is so, see Chapter 27 of PIANO ACCORDION OWNER\u2019S MANUAL AND BUYER\u2019S GUIDE). The mathematical formula for determining the number of cents equivalent to one beat per second at each note boils down to the following: For any given note whose frequency in hertz (cycles per second) is F, the frequency of a note one cent higher is F x 2 to the 1/1200 power, the frequency of a note 2 cents higher is F x 2 to the 2/1200 power, and so on, right on up to a note 100 cents higher, i.e., a full semitone higher, having a frequency of F x 2 to the 100/1200 power (the same as the 1/12 power of 2, which is the basis for an equal temperament 12-note scale). Musette tuning calculations - (We won\u2019t actually do much calculation here, but if even the passing discussion of math bores you, skip now to the cheat sheet.) For a convenient example, let\u2019s take the case of a note 10 cents higher than frequency F. According to the formula, this higher note has a frequency of F x 2 to the 10/1200 power. The hertz difference between these two note frequencies is F x 2 to the 10/1200 power minus F. This hertz difference is exactly equal to the beat frequency that will be generated by playing these two notes together (for a clear, plain language explanation of why this is so, see Chapter 27 of PIANO ACCORDION OWNER\u2019S MANUAL AND BUYER\u2019S GUIDE). Since we are comparing two notes exactly ten cents apart, this beat frequency is the number of tremolo bps that result from ten cents deviation at this particular note. To get the number of cents deviation required to generate just one tremolo beat per second, we must divide 10 by this number. For instance, applying this formula (F x 2 to the 10/1200 power) at piano A4 (440 hertz), tells us that a note ten cents higher has the frequency 442.55 hertz. Subtracting F (440) from 442.55 gives us the difference between these two notes, which is 2.55 hertz. Since each hertz of difference generates one beat per second, we know that these two notes played together will generate a beat of 2.55 bps. In other words, ten cents of difference generates a beat of 2.55 bps at A440. Dividing 10 by 2.55 tells us that 3.92 cents difference generates one beat per second at A440.","title":"The real essence of tuning: Investigation, Analysis, and Planning"},{"location":"accordion-repair3/#the-cheat-sheet","text":"This formula may appear difficult to evaluate, but in fact it is quite easy on an Excel spreadsheet, and I have done it for you and posted the results below. The chart shows how many cents difference are required at each note to achieve 1 bps tremolo beat. Double that many cents will generate a 2 bps tremolo beat. If you want to generate a 3.25 bps tremolo beat on a particular note, multiply the cents value of 1 bps by 3.25. This chart is an essential aid when we are tuning to the beat. Let's say we hear a beat of 2.25 bps on one note that, according to our tuning plan is supposed to produce a beat of 3.25 bps, that is, it should beat 1 bps faster. Assuming this particular musette set is tuned sharp, the chart tells us how many cents we need to further sharpen this particular reed in order to increase the beat by one more bps. If we are tuning a set that is tuned flat, it tells us how many cents we need to flatten it. If the beat of a particular note needs to be raised or lowered by 0.75 bps, then multiply the number in the chart by 0.75, and so on. This is your cheat sheet. It allows you to quickly calculate how many cents correction you need to apply to the current tuning in order to alter the current beat pattern to fit your tuning plan for each individual note. It is the single most essential ingredient for successful musette tuning, yet I have never found it published anywhere. As far as I know, this is its first appearance.","title":"The cheat sheet"},{"location":"accordion-repair3/#proper-musette-tuning-procedure","text":"With this background information in mind, we can now recap in outline form the proper procedure for tuning a musette accordion, which is the most complex type to tune. Details for steps 1, 2, and 3 have already been provided. Details for steps 4, 5, and 6 are provided later on. For a dry tuned accordion, skip steps 5 and 6. Step 1: Determine the basis of its tuning (A=440, etc.). Set your electronic tuner to this standard, and save the setting (or the next time you turn it on, it may revert to the default setting). Step 2: Check all reeds for security and condition (wax, leathers, rust, grime), and remedy any defects. Step 3. Identify and label each reed set. Step 4: Tune dry reeds as necessary Step 5: Develop your musette tuning plan in terms of the beat progression you want. Step 6: Tune your musette reeds, one musette reed set at a time. Step 4: Tuning dry reeds Using the tuning bellows - When tuning, it is important to understand that each reed tongue will vibrate at a different frequency in the accordion than on your tuning bellows. This is due to several factors including reversed air flow on the tuning bellows and differences in physical surroundings. Although the reeds will have to be tuned outside the accordion on your tuning bellows, you will want them to be in tune when installed in the accordion. You must establish a tuning bellows target value for each reed tongue that will put it in tune once it is back in the accordion. For your dry tuned reeds, measure how many cents each reed tongue is out of tune, and in which direction, while the reeds are installed in the accordion. Unless you are using Dirk's Tuner, which can listen to more than one reed at a time, you must turn off all reed sets other than the one you are measuring. If you have an A440 accordion, you can use the Marcus Cavanaugh iPad/IPhone app referenced above, but if you are tuning to some other value of A, then you will have to use a strobe tuner or virtual strobe tuner that can be set to that standard. I use the Peterson VS-II Virtual Strobe tuner, which used to list for $359, but has been discontinued and is now available used in places like eBay, often for around $100. Express any deviation you find as a correction factor. For instance if you find that a reed is three cents flat, then your correction factor will be to sharpen it three cents. Use the tuning bellows to measure and determine when you have achieved your correction factor. For the sake of efficiency (to avoid opening the accordion hundreds of times) measure the tuning of all the reeds in one set (bassoon, clarinet, or piccolo) at one sitting and make a chart showing the amount and direction of the required correction for each reed tongue. Then test those same reeds on the tuning bellows (still mounted in their reed blocks, naturally, and with leathers still installed), and note on the chart how far out of tune each one appears to be on the tuning bellows and in which direction. You will not be tuning to eliminate this indicated error, as it will probably be different from the real error noted while the reed block was in the accordion. You will use this tuning bellows reading only as a base line for calculating your tuning bellows target value for each reed tongue. Calculate the desired tuning bellows target value by applying the correction factor determined while the reed block was still mounted in the accordion, and note the tuning bellows target value on your chart. Then tune the reed tongue to that target value on the tuning bellows. Use the tuning bellows just to measure the amount of correction being made. The tuning bellows target value will not be zero (zero cents out of tune) unless the reed happens to have the same frequency inside the accordion as it does on the tuning bellows, which is uncommon. For example, a typical reed tongue might be out of tune by +6 cents (6 cents too sharp) in the accordion. In that case you will note a required correction factor of minus (-) 6 cents (flatten it by 6 cents to bring it to zero cents out of tune in the accordion). If that same reed tongue is out of tune by +9 cents on the tuning bellows, your tuning bellows target value will be +3 cents (9 minus 6) and you will flatten it by 6 cents to get it there. When you put it back in the accordion and test it again, it should be exactly in tune. As a final check after tuning to make sure your allowed dry reed tuning tolerances are not too great, play each possible dry pair of reeds (a dry pair being the one you are tuning plus its octave mate from another dry reed set) together and listen for any beat that would indicate one of the reeds is out of tune, and retune any problem pairs to eliminate the beat. For instance, if your tolerances allow the low F in your bassoon set to be up to 3 cents flat and the low F in your piccolo set to be up to 2 cents sharp, and if both happen to be at opposite extremes of their tolerance ranges, this 5 cent difference might result in an audible beat when they are played together. In this case, one of those reeds will have to be tuned closer to the value of the other to eliminate the beat. In most cases with these stated tolerances, the pairs won\u2019t be at opposite ends of their allowable ranges and will be well enough matched to preclude any noticeable beat. Only if one of the reeds is near one limit of the tolerance and the other reed is near the opposite limit will you have a problem. Have a clear, well organized worksheet where you can post the current tuning bellows reading, the correction factor to be applied, and the resulting tuning bellows target value for each reed tongue. It helps to color code the worksheet columns containing your inner reed tongue readings, correction factors, and targets to help prevent inadvertently reading the value for an external tongue while trying to tune an internal tongue. Constantly double check to ensure that you are looking at the correct target value for the reed tongue you are tuning and that you are tuning the correct tongue on the correct reed in the correct reed set, and that you are tuning it in the right direction (i.e., not inadvertently sharpening it when you actually need to flatten it). Organization, focus, and perspective- Skill, dexterity, and judgment are all required to successfully tune, but of equal importance are organization, focus, and perspective. It is important to be organized and focused, yet always keep in mind the big picture in order to avoid inadvertently tuning the wrong reed, or the wrong tongue, or tuning in the wrong direction, or by the wrong amount. Many pitfalls - There are many opportunities for error, confusion, or distractions to ruin your tuning job. For instance, your tuner could be set to A=442 or some other value not applicable to your accordion, which would give you the wrong readings for every reed. Or you could misread the tuner readout and write down that the reed must be sharpened, when it really needs to be flattened. You could accidentally enter the value for the inner reed tongue in the column for outer reed tongue values, or on the line for a different note, or accidentally write a minus sign when you meant to write a plus sign, or misread your own handwriting. Once you have the values written down, you could miscalculate the correction required or you might calculate correctly but use a wrong value in the calculation, perhaps due to reading it from the wrong column on your chart. Even if you avoid all measurement, calculation, and tabulation errors and produce a perfectly accurate chart of all the reeds and their required corrections and tuning bellows target values, there are still plenty of opportunities for error during the actual tuning of the reeds. You might inadvertently tune the inner tongue to the value desired for the outer tongue, or tune the wrong reed altogether, or be on the wrong reed block, or sharpen a reed when you should have flattened it. You might be closing the tuning bellows (sounding the interior reed) while thinking you are checking the tuning you just did on the exterior reed. Whatever the reason for the error, I know from experience that it is very disheartening to find that you have taken metal off the wrong reed tongue, or off the wrong end of the right reed tongue. You should never take your eye or hand off the reed you are tuning. If you must look away to pick up a tool, then keep your finger on the reed plate you wish to tune. If you don't, you may find yourself tuning the wrong reed. Practice on accordions of little value in order to learn to systematically avoid all these pitfalls before tuning an accordion of value. Even if you have got everything right so far, and are tuning the correct reed tongue in the right direction toward the correct target value, you are still not out of the woods. It is very easy to accidentally take off too much metal and overshoot your tuning target. Most often this happens when light filing or scratching is apparently not changing the tuning (or maybe even changing it in the wrong direction) so you get a little more aggressive with it. This frequently occurs when your scratching or filing is displacing (relocating) metal, but not actually removing it, or perhaps displacing enough metal to cancel out the tuning impact of any metal you remove. For instance, filing the tip of the reed tongue (to sharpen the pitch) can actually flatten the pitch by shifting burrs of metal (mass or weight) toward the reed tip rather than removing them entirely. Similarly, scratching the lower third of the reed (to flatten the pitch) can sometimes sharpen the pitch by plowing up tiny burrs and shifting them toward the fixed end of the reed rather than removing them entirely. If the next pass of the file or scratcher finally removes these burrs, you will get a sudden jump in the reed frequency, perhaps well beyond your target value. Then you are faced with taking metal off the opposite end to correct the overshoot. You can avoid this trap by carefully and thoroughly scraping off all burrs before taking each measurement. In any case, the important thing to remember is that you sharpen pitch by shifting the reed tongue's center of gravity toward the fixed end, and you flatten pitch by shifting the center of gravity toward the free end. You can shift the center of gravity either by removing metal or by shifting metal around. For more details on how this is done, see the chapter on Putting File to Metal. There are many other tuning pitfalls to avoid. If you let your thumb or any part of your hand hang over the edge of the reed block above the reed while sounding that reed on your tuning bellows, the proximity of your hand will flatten the pitch of the reed. This effect may overshadow the effect of your most recent scratching or filing, providing erroneous feedback and leading you to erroneous conclusions about whether or not additional filing is required. Not having the opening in the bottom of the reed block fully over the opening in the top of your tuning bellows will also give erroneous readings. Gripping the reed block tightly while filing or scratching a reed can compress or displace or wrinkle the leather on some other reed, which can change that other reed's tuning. Similarly, replacing a leather can change the tuning, especially if the length of the glued-down portion of the new leather is not exactly the same as on the old. When you begin tuning that reed, blindly applying the previously determined correction factor may produce an undesirable result. If rough handling or replacing leathers has changed the tuning of any reed, a new correction factor must be determined for that reed before attempting to tune it. Naturally this requires putting the reed block back in the accordion and checking the tuning of that reed again. Great care must be taken not to damage the reed tongue or the reed plate while tuning. This is especially important in the highest pitch reeds in the piccolo reed set, say, from the highest A down to the C below. It is very common to find these reeds silent due to being damaged by excessive force during a previous tuning. I have found them arched, cupped, twisted, even kinked. Reeds with any of these defects are impossible to voice properly, and should be replaced with new. However, they can sometimes be straightened with a bit of tedious careful work under 10x - 20x magnification (see the chapter on \u201cStraightening Piccolo Reeds\u201d). Reeds can be ruined by removing too much metal in one place. Creating thin spots can theoretically change the timbre and encourage cracks. Reeds can also be ruined by bending them too far while getting them in position to file, or by pressing too hard with the file or the scratcher, or by filing or scratching without providing proper support behind the reed tongue (the smaller the reed, the more vulnerable it is to this kind of mishandling). Inadvertently narrowing the reed tongue or shortening its tip can ruin a reed by increasing the clearance between the reed tongue and the vent. Scratching or nicking the reed plate at the edge of the vent can similarly ruin the reed. Occasionally the file will drag a metal burr or metal filing to the edge of the reed tongue, where it will wedge between the reed tongue and the vent, preventing the reed from sounding properly. These can usually be removed by passing a .0015\" metal feeler gauge between the tongue and the vent, or by dragging it along the edge of the reed tongue, or sometimes by plucking the reed until it vibrates freely. However, don't push the feeler gauge too far into the vent, or you may damage or dislodge the leather on the opposite side. And don't pull the reed too far up to pluck it, or you may alter its voicing. More insidious is the effect of a tiny burr on the edge of the tongue that serves to slow the reed just enough to put it slightly out of tune rather than stopping it entirely. This can mislead you into thinking the reed must be sharpened in pitch, when all it really needs is to be wiped clean. If you file it again before wiping it clean, you may overshoot your target value. Similarly, the file or scraper or your finger can drag soft wax or other contaminant to the reed tongue and deposit it there, which will alter the center of gravity and thus the frequency until you wipe it clean. It is important to remove all wax from the top of the reed plate before tuning any reed, in order to minimize the possibility of dragging that wax onto the reed tongue during tuning. Occasionally, your efforts to support the interior reed tongue from below will dislodge or damage the interior leather, throwing the interior reed tongue alongside of it suddenly out of tune and skewing your readings for it. If you don\u2019t notice this problem right away, the erroneous and misleading feedback from your electronic tuner may cause you to file or scratch more than necessary. Once you discover and correct the problem, you may find that you have significantly overshot your tuning target and that you now have to tune that same reed tongue back in the opposite direction. One major difficulty in checking the tuning and determining correction factors is the fact that reed frequency decreases (flattens) under higher air pressures, especially on the lowest frequency reeds. You might have a reed perfectly in tune at one bellows pressure, yet the next time you test it you will get a different reading if you use a slightly different bellows pressure. This makes it impossible to tune efficiently, as you cannot tell whether the change in reading is due to the scratching you just did, or to differences in bellows pressures. And if you have one reed perfectly in tune at one bellows pressure and another reed perfectly in tune at some other bellows pressure, then whenever you play those notes together, they will be out of tune with each other. Tuning at constant pressure with a manometer - This problem can be avoided only by tuning and testing at least all the low note reeds at the same bellows pressure (the low notes are the most sensitive to pressure changes). A simple home-made U- tube manometer can be used to measure bellows pressure and to provide a reference that allows you to apply the same bellows pressure to every reed. I used some old clear plastic medical oxygen hose for the tubing, food coloring to color an ounce or so of water, an eye dropper to put the colored water into the clear tubing. I mounted the tubing on an empty white plastic gallon jug to hold it in the proper U-shape, to support it in an upright viewing position, and to provide a white background behind the red liquid. To work properly, one end of the tubing must be open to the atmosphere and extended a few inches above the liquid level to prevent any liquid from being blown out under bellows pressure. The other end must be looped to a similar height and connected to the bellows through some convenient length. To connect the manometer to the tuning bellows I drilled an oversized hole in the top cover plate and used a piece of foam rubber as a stopper to seal around the hose. Before installing it, I made a hole through the foam stopper and forced the hose through the hole. To connect the manometer to the accordion I remove the bass plate and the air release button and valve, and insert the manometer hose into the air release valve port, again using a piece of foam rubber as a stopper to seal around the hose. I route the hose out through the air release button hole in the bass plate and reinstall the bass plate so I can play the accordion while it is hooked to the manometer. I mark the level of the liquid at rest in the manometer on the plastic jug behind each leg of the U-tube with a felt pen, then while playing the accordion normally, I note the fluctuations in liquid level with varying bellows pressure and sound volume. Based on those observations I select an appropriate liquid level (bellows pressure) to use in tuning and mark that on the jug behind each tube, one for each bellows direction. When measuring the tuning of any reed in the accordion or on the tuning bellows, I can now hold constant bellows pressure at the appropriate level using the manometer as a reference. Atmospheric factors - Even at constant bellows pressure, the tuning of any reed will vary from day to day due to changes in air temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure, all of which impact air density, one of the important determinants of the frequency at which any reed will vibrate. Expansion due to temperature changes also minutely changes the length of the reed tongue and hence the location of its center of gravity relative to the fixed end, another major determinant of the reed's vibration frequency. We intuitively expect to see reeds slow down due to an increase in temperature, as the reed tongue expands, carrying its center of gravity away from the fixed end. However, it is apparently not quite that simple, as on a recent test of three reeds (Piano A3, A4, and A5) at three distinct temperatures (48, 68, and 88 degrees Fahrenheit) I found, contrary to my expectations, that all three reeds were actually 1 \u00bd to 2 \u00bd cents sharper at 68 degrees than they had been at 48 degrees, although at 88 degrees the trend had reversed and the largest one was back to being about half a cent flatter than it had been at 68 degrees. (I would need more data points to plot a curve that would reveal at what temperature the trend actually reverses for each reed.) I can offer no theoretical explanation of why this reversal occurs. Tuning variations due to temperature changes are not a problem if all the reeds are tuned at about the same temperature, because they will change together. But if you tune one reed set on a 60 degree day and another on an 80 degree day, you may have to compensate for the temperature difference. The lowest notes often seem unstable - The lowest note bassoon reeds are more difficult to tune because they tend to drift in frequency, even at constant bellows pressure. The higher notes vibrate at a consistent frequency that your tuner can reliably measure to within one tenth of one cent, but on the lowest notes the tuner readout fluctuates, sometimes by several cents, sometimes eventually settling down to one value, but more often oscillating through some range of values. After you file or scratch, you can't know for sure how much of the change in readout is due to your tuning and how much is due to drift, or to measuring at a different phase of the oscillation cycle. You have to take an average, or decide to always use the value showing after some arbitrary but consistently measured period of time, such as two seconds after the reed first sounds. I hypothesize that this drift may be due to the uneven weight distribution along the length of the reed tongue (the largest treble reeds are much thicker and heavier at the tip), or it may be due to the large mass of the reed tip intermittently mobilizing more of the reed tongue\u2019s length by occasionally lifting it off the reed plate closer to the rivet. Whatever the reason, you will not be able to tune these reeds to the degree of accuracy that is possible at the higher notes. Final check - Once all the reeds in a set have been tuned, check the operation of every reed in both directions on your tuning bellows (in case any have become jammed by tuning debris) then put the reed blocks back in the accordion and check the tuning again. This will highlight any errors or discrepancies that you will need to correct in a second round of tuning. Also check for proper voicing, as the forces imposed on the reeds during tuning can upset the voicing (especially on the smallest reeds), and you will want to correct any voicing problems at the same time you are correcting any final tuning discrepancies. Voicing the reeds - Voicing involves setting the free tip of the reed tongue to the optimum height above the reed plate. The optimum height is that which will require the least possible amount of air to get the reed tongue moving, yet not so close that it chokes (balks under sudden high bellows pressure). The proper height is typically about one reed thickness, but this is really just a starting point. The actual optimum height must be determined by feel and by ear. If the clearance is too great, the reed responds slowly and sluggishly, especially under light bellows pressure, because too much air leaks through the resulting excessive clearance around the reed tongue. If the clearance is too narrow, the reed will not sound at all under sudden high bellows pressure, presumably because its initial stroke is too short to accumulate enough spring energy to overcome the air pressure and bounce back, as would be required for it to begin oscillating. Finding the sweet spot can be tricky because if the clearance is ever so slightly less than the optimum, the reed can partially choke, that is, it can refuse to sound immediately, but eventually get going, which can sound a lot like a reed responding sluggishly because it has too much clearance. This can fool you into reducing the clearance some more, which will cause it to choke completely on the next trial. Generally, if a reed's threshold of response under very light bellows pressure is identical to its immediate neighbors, it is probably properly voiced. Any reed that requires more bellows pressure than its neighbors probably needs voicing. For detailed instructions on voicing reeds, see the article on page \"Accordion Repair 1\". Step 5: Developing your musette tuning plan Developing your musette tuning plan involves several tasks: a) deciding what beat progression you want for each musette reed set, b) documenting the current beat progression for each M set paired individually with the dry clarinet set, c) comparing the existing beat progression to your desired beat progression to get a tuning correction factor measured in bps for each reed tongue, d) calculating an equivalent tuning correction factor measured in cents for each reed tongue, e) measuring each reed tongue\u2019s current tuning on the test bellows in terms of cents, and f) applying the calculated cents correction factor to get a tuning bellows target value (in cents) for each reed tongue. I usually complete steps a) through d) for the whole reed set before going on to e) and f), which I complete for each reed tongue just before I clean and then tune it. I tune each reed tongue to match its tuning bellows target value before going on to e) and f) for the next reed tongue. Here is a more detailed explanation of each task: a) Deciding what beat progression you want was covered earlier under \u201cMany possible tuning plans\u201d. To be useful during tuning, it must be in the form of a list of the desired beat frequencies to the nearest 0.1 bps for each note on your treble keyboard. b) Documenting the current beat progression was partially covered earlier under \u201cAnalyzing beat progressions\u201d. To that I can add a few tips: With the reeds in the accordion, and with the treble switches set to play just the dry clarinet set and the single musette set you are tuning, play each note in both bellows directions and make a list of the current beats for each note in each bellows direction. If switches don\u2019t allow this reed combination, then insert paper strips under the reed blocks to block air flow to the rows of reeds you do not wish to hear. If your accordion has more than one musette reed set, repeat this for each of those sets individually paired with the dry clarinet set. c) Comparing the current beat progression to the desired beat progression involves simple subtraction and listing the correction required (in bps) in the proper column for each reed tongue, paying careful attention to the direction of the required correction. d) Calculating an equivalent tuning correction factor measured in cents is just multiplying the bps correction factor by the cheat sheet bps-to-cents conversion factor for that note. I use a chart which I call my Musette Reed Tuning Worksheet. It has 12 columns and 45 rows. The 4 top rows are for labeling and grouping columns, and the other 41 are dedicated 1 row for each treble note. The first column contains the names of the notes, the second and third columns are for entering the beginning bps for each bellows direction (as measured with reeds in the accordion), and the fourth and fifth are for listing the correction required (in bps) for each bellows direction in order to match the desired beat progression. The sixth column is just a reproduction of my cheat sheet, listing the cents per bps conversion factor for each note, and the seventh and eighth columns are for listing the calculated correction factor in cents for each bellows direction. This much I complete before taking the reeds out of the accordion. The last four columns are for listing: e) beginning cents deviation for each tongue as measured on the tuning bellows, and f) the tuning bellows target value for each tongue, which is derived by applying the cents correction factor to the beginning cents deviation for each tongue. To help keep the data properly organized and prevent errors, I use yellow highlighting to denote all columns pertaining to inner reed tongues. The completed chart constitutes a complete formulation of my musette reed tuning plan for one musette reed set. Step 6: Tuning Musette Reeds Tune your musette reeds one musette reed set at a time. Before removing the reed blocks from the accordion, make sure each row of reeds is properly labeled, as discussed in \u201cWet or Dry?\u201d, above. Establish the tuning bellows base line and the tuning bellows target value for each reed as you go, as detailed in e) and f) of step 5, above, then carefully clean each reed before you tune it. Check it on the test bellows again to see how much it improved due to the cleaning. Then tune each musette reed tongue to its tuning bellows target value, just as you did for the dry reed sets. Correcting errors and newly discovered problems \u2013 After all the musette reeds are tuned, put the reed blocks back in the accordion and check every musette reed pair again, in each bellows direction, making note of any needed corrections to the beat frequency on a fresh Musette Reed Tuning Worksheet. Use the cheat sheet column to convert each bps correction factor to cents. Establish a new tuning bellows base line for each reed tongue needing additional tuning, apply the cents correction factor to arrive at a new tuning bellows target value for each reed tongue needing additional tuning, and tune each of those reed tongues to its target value, just as you did the first time through. Occasionally, you may discover that the beat frequency for one of the pairs increases or decreases with changes in bellows pressure. Even though the higher note reeds are generally less prone to frequency drift in response to changes in bellows pressure, in the case of musette pairs the beat is so sensitive to minute changes in frequency that if one member of the pair drifts ever so slightly more than the other, the beat will change noticeably. If your final check reveals a reed pair whose beat varies noticeably with bellows pressure, then one of those reeds may have a loose rivet. I don\u2019t mean \u201cfalling out loose\u201d, or even \u201cwandering off-center\u201d loose. I mean just barely loose enough to allow a tiny bit more of the reed tongue to lift off the reed plate right next to the rivet whenever you get the reed tongue swinging wide by playing it at high volume. This increases the effective length of that reed tongue, lowering its pitch. In this case, you will have to identify which reed tongue is causing the problem and reset its rivet. If the musette set you are tuning is sharper than your clarinet set, a slower beat under high bellows pressure indicates the musette reed is going flat, while a faster beat under high pressure indicates that the clarinet reed is the culprit. If the musette set you are tuning is flatter than the clarinet set, then a slower beat implicates the clarinet reed, while a faster beat implicates the musette reed. In either case, if the problem occurs while opening the bellows, the inner tongue is causing the problem. If it occurs while the bellows is closing, the outer tongue is the one to repair. You can also identify which reed tongue you have to tighten by testing all four reed tongues individually on your test bellows with the Marcus Cavanaugh tuning app running on your iPad. Watch the readout as you vary tuning bellows pressure. If the frequency of any one of those tongues wanders more under bellows pressure changes than the other four, you will know to reset the rivet on that tongue. However you identify it, take the offending reed out of the reed block, place one end of the problem rivet on the edge of an anvil (just that rivet should contact the anvil, not the whole reed plate, not any reed tongue, and not both rivets) and give the other end of that rivet a couple of light raps with a hammer. Don\u2019t hit it too hard, as you don\u2019t want to distort the aluminum reed plate, which is relatively soft. Wax the reed back into the reed block, install it in the accordion, and test that pair again. If your hammer taps were sufficient, the problem will be solved, and the beat will be stable. However, it may not be stable at precisely the bps you want, in which case you will have to retune the reed tongue whose rivet you reset. With your cheat sheet in hand, it will be easy to arrive at a new correction factor in cents and a new tuning bellows target value, just as you did before. Musette Tuning tolerances - A look at the cheat sheet reveals that the tuning tolerances must be considerably tighter for musette reeds than for dry reeds, especially near the upper end of the 41 note scale. Tune to within two cents of your target at the low end of the keyboard, because at the lowest F, 2 cents equates to about 0.2 bps, which is as much accuracy as you need. Gradually decrease this margin of error as you ascend the scale, until at the very top tune to the nearest 0.2 cents, because at the highest A, 0.2 cents equates to about 0.2 bps. If each note is tuned to within 0.2 bps of your tuning plan it will sound perfectly tuned to anyone. If you let the tolerances wander to about 0.5 bps, some people (other accordion tuners, mostly) will notice. Most people are oblivious to beat frequencies, and will not notice anything wrong unless the beat is way off, in which case they will know it sounds bad, but they won\u2019t know why.","title":"Proper musette tuning procedure"},{"location":"accordion-repair3/#cleaning-reeds","text":"The time honored way to clean reeds is by taking them out of the reed block, cleaning off the wax, and soaking them in benzine or carbon tetrachloride. That is not practical if you are not re-waxing the accordion, and in any case, I do not recommend using such toxic chemicals. Some people clean them in a liquid bath in an ultrasonic cleaner, but I can\u2019t help wondering if there is any water in that liquid, and if so, what happens to the water that gets in between the reed plate and the rivet tongue all around the rivet. I prefer to clean mechanically. I use a tiny brass wire brush which I make by pulling individual tufts from a small wooden handled wire brush available at hardware stores (find a brush with the straight brass wire bristles, don\u2019t buy one with curly bristles). Grip each tuft individually near the bottom with needle nose pliers and pull it out of the wood. Crimp a short length of steel tubing (I use 1/8\u201d automotive brake line) onto each individual tuft to use as a handle, and snip the bristles to about 1/4\" long, making a stiff narrow brush that fits down into the reed vent. Crimp one tuft in each end of the tube and on a few of them bend one set of bristles 90 degrees for working inside the reed block. These brushes work well for cleaning all but the underside of the outer reed tongue (unless you remove the reed from the reed block, in which case all surfaces are equally accessible). If you are working with a reed still mounted in its reed block, work from the outside, in order not to have to remove the interior leather. Lift the outer tongue and scrape the underside of it with a dull blade, such as the edge of a .004\u201d or thicker metal feeler gauge, then pluck it to shake off the debris. This is not a perfect way to clean, but it is better than no cleaning at all. Then check its tuning again. After cleaning the reed in this manner you may have to file less than you originally thought, and sometimes you may not have to file at all. Sometimes cleaning alone brings the reed back into tune. Don\u2019t clean it before you establish its tuning bellows target value, though, or you will have to put it back in the accordion to establish a new correction factor.","title":"Cleaning reeds"},{"location":"accordion-repair3/#aligning-reed-tongues","text":"If the reed is silent or flat because the reed tongue is out of perfect alignment with the vent, you will have to re-center it. With the reed removed from the reed block and held up to a bright background, verify visually that the spaces between the reed tongue and the vent are equal on both sides of the tongue. This takes a bit of skill, because if you do not look precisely straight on, or if your viewing angles from either side of straight on are not exactly symmetrical, one gap may seem wider when it is really not. Sometimes it helps to rock the reed tongue down into the vent before sighting through the gap. Claudio Binci routinely centers his newly made reed tongues by this method, and when he finishes, the clearance on either side of the tongue is exactly .0015\u201d. Actually, the narrower the clearances, the easier it is to detect any asymmetry. The easiest way to re-center the tongue is to lever it back to the proper position. Insert a thin blade into the narrower space (midway along the tongue, so you can lift the tongue far enough to insert the blade, but not too close to the tip) and gently pry the reed tongue back to center. Take care not to twist the reed tongue or to damage the edge of the vent. If the reed tongue has worked its way off-center, it can only be because the rivet is too loose, so once you have it centered, you should reset the rivet, as described above, in \u201cCorrecting Errors and Newly Discovered Problems\u201d. Naturally, you must wax the reed back into the reed block when you are finished.","title":"Aligning reed tongues"},{"location":"accordion-repair3/#putting-file-to-metal","text":"Tuning is mostly about investigation, analysis, planning, organization, focus, and perspective, so it is appropriate that most of this tuning chapter has been dedicated to those critically important ingredients of tuning. However, that brings us to the remaining ingredients, which are skill, dexterity, and judgment, and this is where we finally put file to metal. Re-tuning in three stages - If you choose to re-tune, i.e., to alter the basic tuning by tuning to a different A, or to change a dry tuned accordion to wet (see the chapter on Tuning Musette Reeds), you should take the reeds out of the reed block for the first of three tuning stages. Re-tuning requires a lot of filing in the first stage, and adjacent reeds and leathers get in your way, making filing difficult. If you have a lot of filing to do, it is much easier to file a reed the same way the reed maker does, with the reed plate out of the reed block and lightly clamped in a vise, and with the leathers removed. The first tuning stage will be done with a file (except for the tiniest piccolo reeds), filing straight across the reed tongue (unless you are working on the tip, in which case you file directly toward or away from the rivet) to bring the reed to within a couple of cents of the final value. You need not obsess over small deviations at this stage, because the tuning will probably change anyway, perhaps by several cents, when you install the reed valves and wax the reed back into the reed block. You will not be able to compensate in advance for this change, because part of it is unpredictable. Sometimes the reed sharpens when mounted in the reed block and sometimes it flattens. Sometimes you get lucky and the change is very small or even zero. To check your progress during this first stage, place the reed directly over the aperture on the tuning table and draw air over the reed while managing your tuner. An assortment of different apertures will be required to fit the various reed sizes, so you must devise some way to fit those various apertures to your tuning bellows or tuning table. One way is to make a large opening in the top plate of your bellows and make an assortment of covers for this opening, each with a different sized aperture. One way to secure these covers is to slide them into slots cut around the top interior edge of three sides of a box mounted over the large aperture, as shown in the photo below. I\u2019m sure there are other ways, as well, but in any case, you should line your apertures with leather, fuzzy side up, to maintain a good air seal between the reed plate and the bellows. The second tuning stage is also done outside the accordion, but with the reeds mounted (waxed) into the reed block and with all reed valves (leathers) in place. The goal at this stage is to bring the tuning to within a cent or two of the desired final value. You will use a file this time, too, but this time file diagonally so as not to damage the leathers on adjacent reeds (you will probably ruin a few leathers anyway, so have some replacements on hand). It would be pointless to attempt this tuning stage without the leathers in place, because installing them later would change the tuning again, requiring an additional round of tuning. The third and final tuning stage must be done in the accordion because installing the reed block into the accordion changes the tuning yet again. However, understand that tuning in the accordion does not necessarily mean actually filing or scratching the reed tongue while the reed block is mounted in the accordion, although this is sometimes done. For our purposes, tuning in the accordion means measuring the tuning deviation with the reed block mounted in the accordion, then taking the reed block out to make the necessary correction. This is because every reed tongue must be supported while you file it, and the reed tongues facing into the reed block can best be supported from the inside of the reed block, which is most easily and reliably done with the reed block out of the accordion. In this final stage you will be eliminating small deviations on the order of a few cents at most, so you may be using a scratcher, rather than a file (especially on the smaller reeds). If the needed correction is a cent or more on the largest reeds, or more than a few cents on the smaller reeds, you can start with the file (except on the tiniest reeds, where files are too crude), but once you have it within a cent on the largest reeds and within a few cents on the smaller reeds, switch to a scratcher to avoid overshooting your tuning target. On the tiniest piccolo reeds, both the file and scratcher are too course and crude, and you will be better off using only fairly fine sand paper, perhaps around #220. See the chapter on Tuning Tiny Piccolo Reeds. Spot Tuning - If you choose not to alter the basic tuning of your accordion, and if you are just tuning a few reeds that are noticeably out of tune with the rest, you will have a much easier time of it because in most cases you will begin with the third tuning stage. If a few reeds are out of tune by more than you can comfortably correct with scratching or diagonal filing, you can take them out of the reed block individually (after establishing the needed correction, of course), rather than having to re-wax the entire reed block. Tuning with a file - Tuning with a file is a fairly aggressive tactic, and requires a good sense of touch and pressure, a good memory for how many cents of change results from any given amount of file pressure on the various reed sizes, and considerable finesse. Files remove lots of metal, so typically not much filing is required to bring a reed back into tune. Make one light stroke and see what difference that makes to the tuning, and based on that, estimate how many identical light strokes will be required to bring it in line with your tuning bellows target value. Not all strokes are equal. With practice, you will learn to tell by feel how much metal you have removed with each stroke. If the file skips lightly over the reed, offering little resistance, you obviously remove much less metal than if it seems to dig in and offer significant resistance. One heavy stroke can remove as much as many light strokes. Until you develop a good feel for this, check your results frequently, perhaps after each stroke, in order to avoid overshooting your target. When filing an exterior reed tongue to flatten its pitch, file in the bottom third of the reed tongue. Insert a reed lifter or metal feeler gauge under the reed tongue to support it while you file. Extend the reed lifter or feeler gauge out over the adjacent reed valve to protect it from your file. When filing the tip of either an exterior or interior reed tongue, file directly toward or away from the rivet. Slip a flat reed lifter under the tip to protect the reed plate and adjacent leathers. Take great care to file only the top surface, not the end or sides, as the clearance between the reed tongue and the sides and end of the vent is critical, and you must not do anything to enlarge it. In handmade reeds and hand fitted reeds, this clearance is only .0015, so even a very light file stroke could double it, essentially ruining the reed. The smaller the reed, the more vulnerable it is to this kind of damage. On the very smallest piccolo reeds, where the reed tongue may only be .002\u201d thick, you dare not use a file at all. In order to file the tip of an interior reed tongue, the tip of the tongue must be lifted up through the vent for access. This is done by inserting a small tool, wood, metal, or plastic, in through the opening in the bottom of the reed block and out through the tip of the vent. Then slip your flat reed lifter under the tip to support it evenly while you file. Be careful not to lever the reed plate out of the wax mounting during the process. This does not work on the smallest few clarinet reeds and on the top 20 or so piccolo reeds, because the tongue is too short to survive so much bending without suffering permanent damage. As a general rule, if the reed does not have leathers, it is probably too small to have its tongue lifted through the vent without permanently damaging it. In these cases, you can use a scratcher near the tip, taking special care to support the reed tongue evenly from below while you scratch. With this technique, you run the risk of cupping the end of the reed tongue due to excessive pressure and/or inadequate support from below. You also risk pushing burrs off the end of the reed tongue, where they will interfere with the tongue\u2019s passage through the vent, either silencing the reed or throwing it out of tune. If this happens, use the edge of your reed lifter or of a .004\u201d metal feeler gauge to scrape the tip clean. Alternatively, you can take the reed out of the reed block and tune it in your vise. The latter is by far the best course of action for the tiniest of reeds. One of your objectives while filing must be to avoid creating stress concentrations that could lead to cracks. This means don\u2019t cut a groove across the reed, not even a very shallow groove. Don\u2019t remove metal from one tiny area, or from just one edge of the reed tongue. The wider the area and the thinner the layer removed, the better. Your file must be perfectly parallel with the top surface of the reed tongue, so it removes metal equally across the entire width of the reed. The best tuning would be invisible, blending in perfectly with the reed makers original file marks. This degree of perfection is practically impossible to achieve, especially when filing diagonally across the reed tongue, but it is nevertheless a worthwhile goal to keep in mind. The less conspicuous your file marks, the better. Tuning with a scratcher \u2013 When you are so close to your tuning bellows target value that you think one more file stroke might cause an overshoot, switch to using a scratcher. This probably won\u2019t occur on the largest reeds, where it takes several light file strokes to make a cent of difference and where you are tuning to two or three cent accuracy, but on the smaller reeds, where you need more accuracy and where one file stroke can make several cents of difference, you will be using the scratcher often. Unless you choose to remove the reed from the reed block for tuning, you will also use a scratcher whenever flattening the tuning of the interior reed tongue, simply because you cannot get a file down into the vent. To flatten the pitch, use the scratcher to remove metal from the lower third of the reed tongue. If the cents change you need is more than you can get from a few scratches, remove the reed from the reed block so you can tune the originally filed side of it with a file. The number of cents change you can make with a scratcher varies with the size of the reed. On the largest reeds, you may only be able to get one cent or so without severely gouging the reed tongue, which is never a good idea. But on smaller reeds, you can use the scratcher to flatten the pitch by up to a several cents. To sharpen the pitch, you will use a file on the tip, after lifting the tip out of the vent for access. If the reed tongue is too small to lift out of the vent without permanently deforming it, then remove the reed from the reed block so you can scratch or file or sand the other side. Anytime you remove the reed from the reed block for tuning, establish a new tuning bellows base line for it by laying the reed directly on the opening in the top of the tuning bellows. Then apply your previously determined correction factor to get a new tuning bellows target value, which will be different from the tuning bellows target value you established for the reed mounted in the reed block. Tuning with a scratcher can be frustrating, because the changes in tuning you get are sometimes not those you expected, especially if your scratcher just moves metal around without actually removing it (see the discussion under \u201cmany pitfalls\u201d in the Tuning Dry Reeds section). Scratching lightly sometimes does not remove metal, but simply lays over (flattens down) the ridges left by the reed-maker\u2019s file. This is especially likely on handmade reeds, which are harder to scratch and which often exhibit more pronounced file marks. Laying over the file marks does not remove any weight, but it does shift the center of gravity in the direction the tool was traveling, and therefore impacts tuning, perhaps in the direction opposite to what the tuner intended if he was not aware of this subtle aspect of tuning. However, you can use this knowledge to your advantage in a way contrary to conventional wisdom by working any part of the reed tongue downward (i.e., toward the fixed end) to sharpen the pitch, and working any part of the reed tongue upward (i.e., toward the tip) to flatten the pitch. Thus you can, if you wish, sharpen the pitch by working with your scratcher on the lower third of the reed tongue, and flatten the pitch by working near the tip, exactly the opposite of the tuning procedure normally described. You just have to go lightly to be sure you are just laying the ridges over, rather than removing any metal. This technique is especially useful where you need to change the tuning only slightly, say one cent or less, in which case removing any metal at all can cause you to overshoot your target, especially on the smaller reeds. It is also a much gentler way of tuning that avoids the higher pressures that can, if you are not careful, bend or arch the reed tongue in a way that adversely impacts the voicing or otherwise increases air leakage between the reed tongue and the vent. Naturally, this technique works best for the outer reed tongues, on which you have good access to the filed side. On interior reed tongues, unless you remove the reeds from the reed block, you normally work on the unfiled blue side of the tongue, where there are no previous file marks to lay over, so to use this subtle technique you would have to work through the small opening in the bottom of the reed block, where it is very difficult to see what you are doing. Due to those difficulties, I don\u2019t normally try that. I scratch on the unfiled side unless I have taken the reed out of the reed block. Tuning with a Dremmel grinder - Some people tune with just a file and a scratcher, and maybe some fine sand paper, while some others prefer to use a Dremmel grinder. There is great controversy on this point, with some people even saying they would refuse to own an accordion that shows evidence of Dremmel tuning, because they believe the Dremmel grinder ruins the reeds. I have never seen any evidence that Dremmel grinding necessarily ruins reeds. The usual argument against it is that the Dremmel grinder removes too much metal. However, removing metal changes the tuning of the reed, so if too much metal had been removed, the reed would be out of tune. If the reed is in tune, that is strong evidence that exactly the right amount of metal has been removed. I have heard it claimed that if so much metal must be removed to bring it into tune, then the reed is no good anyway and should be replaced. However, I doubt that the person saying this has ever watched reed makers make reeds from scratch. They file very aggressively, removing copious amounts of metal. The amount of metal removed by a Dremmel grinder during a typical tuning is infinitesimally small in comparison. I have always tuned with just a file and a scratcher (and fine sandpaper for the tiniest reeds and for very small adjustments on some larger reeds) for the same reason that I always drill holes by hand. Power tools cut very quickly and it is easy to slip and drill or cut too far, and in an accordion, that can be especially damaging. Hand tools operate more slowly, and seem easier to control. However, I think Dremmel grinders offer certain advantages, and in the hands of a skilled operator, can probably be safe and effective. There is less pressure required, and thus less chance of bending the reed tongue or rotating it out of perfect alignment with the vent. The tiny grind stone is easier to maneuver in tight spaces than the relatively large and unwieldy tuning file, producing less chance of damaging the reed plate or adjacent leather. The high speed grinder removes metal evenly over a larger area, leaving a smoother, cleaner surface, free of scratches, gouges, file marks (stress concentrations that can lead to cracks), and free of the troubling burrs that can skew tuning results. In short, I think that while a Dremmel tool in the wrong hands can do a lot of damage, refusal to tolerate tuning with a Dremmel tool is probably rooted more in fear of change than in rational argument. I may experiment with a Dremmel on a junk accordion someday, to see if I can develop the skill, control, and confidence required to tune effectively with it. Here is a reed that was apparently tuned (flattened) with a Dremmel tool: This reed was tuned (flattened) with both a Dremmel tool and a file: This reed was sharpened by filing at the tip, and also flattened by scratching near the base: (Experienced eyes will detect that these are very old reeds, cut narrower at the base than modern reeds. In fact, these are from 1933.)","title":"Putting File to Metal"},{"location":"accordion-repair3/#tuning-tiny-piccolo-reeds","text":"It is not uncommon to find the highest piccolo reed tongues (generally between the highest C and the highest A) arched, cupped, twisted, or kinked by excessive force during tuning or voicing. The problems are that these reed tongues are so small that it is very difficult to see what you are doing when tuning or voicing them, and they are so fragile that the usual tuning tools are inappropriate for tuning them. The smallest tongues are only about .002\u201d thick near the free end. This is only 2/3 the thickness of a sheet of normal 20# copy paper, so they are very fragile. The teeth of a normal tuning file can catch an edge and tilt it upward, putting a twist in the reed tongue. The force necessary to make a scratch with a tuning scratcher can easily cup or arch the whole reed tongue if it is not very firmly and evenly supported from below. Lifting the reed tongue through the vent so it can be tuned from the outside would overstress it, permanently bending or arching the reed tongue. Attempts to lift or drop the tip to voice the reed can result in only the tip bending, rather than the whole tongue, as is required for proper voicing. Extreme care must be taken when tuning and voicing these reeds, or you will find yourself needing to buy new ones or to spend a lot of time straightening the old ones (see the chapter titled \u201cStraightening Piccolo Reeds). I tune these tiniest reeds with small pieces of #220 sandpaper glued to the ends of small wooden rods. If the interior reed tongue needs tuning, I remove the reed from the reed block so I can tune the filed side of the tongue. I support the tongue during sanding by sliding a .002\u201d metal feeler gauge under it, and for the very smallest ones, such as the one pictured, I use a .0015\u201d feeler gauge. I establish the tuning bellows base line and measure my progress toward the tuning bellows target value by placing the reed directly on my tuning bellows, rather than putting it back in the reed block each time. Only after I have reached my tuning bellows target value do I wax the reed back into the reed block and put it back in the accordion for a final check.","title":"Tuning tiny piccolo reeds"},{"location":"accordion-repair3/#straightening-tiny-piccolo-reeds","text":"If you need to straighten an arched, cupped, twisted, or kinked piccolo reed tongue, you will have to do it under fairly high magnification. The clearance under a properly voiced high A reed is about .0015\u201d (yes, that is 15/10,000 of an inch). It is impossible to see that tiny clearance without appropriate magnification. It is likewise impossible to see arches, waves or twists of that magnitude, yet the reed must be perfectly straight and flat so the tiny critical clearance can be maintained along most of its length. If it is arched or twisted so part of the tongue is higher than that, excessive air will leak between the tongue and the vent, and the reed will respond slowly or not at all. If any part (other than right at the fixed end near the rivet) is lower than that, it will choke. I use a 15x binocular microscope and work under a bright light put very close to the reed. I clamp an anvil (really just a paper clip bent to the appropriate shape) to the base of the microscope, with the end of the anvil extending horizontally into the field of view, and at the proper height to be in focus (the depth of focus at these magnifications is very shallow). I hold the reed plate in one hand, a small bending tool (tiny screwdriver) in the other. I use the anvil to support the reed tongue near where I want it to bend, and apply force with the bending tool to make the bend. I normally rest the shank of the bending tool on the edge of the reed vent and rock the tool into the reed tongue in order to minimize the possibility that the tool might slip toward the free end and cause only the tip of the reed tongue to bend. If I am removing a kink, I slide a narrow strip cut from a .0015\u201d metal feeler gauge under the reed tongue at the kink line to support it there while I press out the kink with either the bending tool or the anvil, or sometimes with both, one to hold the reed tongue firmly against the feeler gauge support, and the other to actually make the bend. To remove twists, I use two narrow strips cut from a .003\u201d metal feeler gauge clamped together to allow slipping the reed tongue endwise between them, and I twist with that. These are extraordinary measures. If you have a new reed in stock or can easily get one, it is cheaper to install a new reed than to spend a half hour straightening the old one. But if getting a new reed takes time and if the delay is intolerable, then you might choose to salvage the old one. It can be done with the proper tools and patience. Naturally, after any significant bending and stretching, the reed is likely to be out of tune, so you should expect to have to tune it. However, a new reed will have to be tuned, also, so time-wise, that might be a wash.","title":"Straightening tiny piccolo reeds"},{"location":"accordion-repair3/#tools-and-supplies-needed-for-tuning","text":"Bellows pin pulling pliers Flat and phillips screwdrivers Tuning bellows Stroboscopic tuner, such as Peterson VS-II Virtual Strobe Tuner (about $300) or, if your accordion is tuned to A=440, and if you have an iPad or iPhone, you can use \"Strobe Tuner Pro\", an app for iPad and iPhone by Marcus Cavanaugh (about $3). Dirk's Tuner, a pc program available online as a download for $150, can listen to up to three reeds at a time and give you a report of the condition of each reed and the required corrections in either cents or hertz.

Dull single edge razor blade for lifting and supporting the smallest reeds during tuning. Resin/alcohol glue (such as Indian Chief gasket shellac available at auto parts stores) for gluing leathers to reed plates. Naphtha or lighter fluid to remove spilled wax residue from reed plates and tongues. Soft cotton rag (with a small spot dampened with lighter fluid) for cleaning up spilled wax residue. Plastic, ironwood, aluminum, or brass scrapers for removing excess wax from reeds and reed blocks (avoid using steel scrapers on aluminum reed plates, as the relatively hard steel will scratch and damage the reed plates). Metal feeler gauges (for clearing stuck reeds, checking clearance between tongue and vent, and for supporting reeds while you file or scratch) A final caution Tuning can be a mind-numbing repetitive process. The chart of tuning data for all the reed tongues can be a blur of columns and numbers. It is very easy to become bored, fatigued, distracted, absent minded, and careless while tuning, and this all too easily leads to mistakes. Here are some tips to help you stay organized and focused. 1) Mark note values (note names) on the reeds or on the reed block or on a piece of tape attached to the reed block to help prevent tuning the wrong reed. Verify that your tuner indicates the correct name of the note you are tuning. 2) Mark the name of the reed set (bassoon white, bassoon black, etc.) on each side of the reed block to help avoid inadvertently tuning a reed in the wrong set. 3) Use worksheets or charts to keep tuning data organized. Make a separate worksheet for each reed set and label it clearly. 4) Make worksheets illustrate the process and numbers used to arrive at the tuning target for each reed in order to facilitate double checking all calculations. 5) Highlight or color code all chart data relating to inner reed tongues to help distinguish them from data relating to outer reed tongues. 6) Use plus signs on all correction factors for reed tongues that need to be sharpened and use minus signs on all correction factors for reed tongues that need to be flattened. 7) Circle each reed tongue's tuning target value as you finish tuning that tongue, in order to reduce the likelihood of inadvertently using that target value again for some other reed. 8) Worksheets should show the initial tuning bellows reading for each reed tongue alongside the tuning bellows target value to facilitate keeping track of progress toward the target value in order to better judge how much additional filing or scratching will be required. This will help avoid overshoots. 9) Be cautious and alert for errors. Double check all calculations. If a target tuning value does not seem right, that is, if it is very different from the target values for neighboring reeds, then double check everything before putting file to metal. It is far easier, and far less disheartening, to correct mistakes on paper than on the reeds themselves. The full explanation of the formula for determining cents per bps for each note. An understanding of exactly how cents relate to hertz (hz), why each cent equates to more hertz at the higher notes, and how to calculate the exact number of hertz that equates to each cent for any note, begins with an understanding of our 12 note equal temperament chromatic scale and the fact that with each octave, the frequency in terms of hertz doubles. At piano A1 the frequency is 55 hz. An octave higher at A2, the frequency is 110 hz, at A3 it is 220 hz, at A4 it is 440 hz, at A5 it is 880 hz, at A6 it is 1760 hz, and at A7 it is 3520 hz. Clearly, each of the 12 equal semitone intervals in any higher octave is spread over a greater number of hertz than its counterpart in any lower octave. Since each semitone interval occupies a greater range of hertz in the higher octave, it follows that each cent (1/100 of a semitone) also occupies a greater range of hertz in the higher octave. We label basic tunings in terms of the note A (A=440, etc.) because only the A notes in our scales have integers (whole numbers) as their frequencies. All the other 11 note frequencies in each octave are then derived from the frequency of the A according to a specific mathematical formula that divides each octave into 12 equal pitch intervals. This formula is exponential, rather than linear, because our perception of pitch is not linearly related to frequency. The relationship between frequency and our sense of pitch is exponential (a linear relationship would imply that each successive octave interval would occupy the same number of hertz, rather than doubling each time). This holds true within each octave, as well. That means we cannot simply divide each octave into 12 equal numbers of hertz, but must instead assign each successively higher note within the octave a greater range of hertz than its predecessor, or the intervals would not sound equal. The formula that does this perfectly is an exponential formula based on the fact that 2 raised to the 1/12 power multiplied by itself 12 times = 2. That is, 21/12 21/12 21/12 21/12 21/12 21/12 21/12 21/12 21/12 21/12 21/12 21/12 = 2(1/12+1/12+1/12+1/12+1/12+1/12+1/12+1/12+1/12+1/12+1/12+1/12) = 21 = 2 By assigning each successive note on the chromatic scale a frequency equal to the frequency of the preceding note x 2 raised to the 1/12 power, after 12 successive notes we arrive at a frequency equal to 2 times the original note. In other words, this formula doubles the frequency at each octave, while making each semitone pitch interval sound equally spaced. Here is the formula applied to calculate the frequencies of each note in the octave immediately above A4: A# = 440 x 21/12 = 440 1.059463094 = 466.1637614 B = A# x 21/12 = A 22/12 = 440 1.122462048 = 493.8833013 C = B x 21/12 = A 23/12 = 440 1.189207115 = 523.2511306 C# = C 21/12 = A 24/12 = A 21/3 = 440 1.25992105 = 554.3652619 D = D# = E = F = F# = G = G# = A 2 11/12 = 440 1.887748624 = 830.6093947 A = G# 2 1/12 = A 2 12/12 = A 2 1 = 440 2= 880 Hertz Just as each successive semitone interval within an octave spans a greater range of hertz as we ascend the scale, so does each cent interval within any semitone span a greater range of hertz as we ascend through 100 cents to get to the next note in the scale. Thus, the difference in terms of hertz between A4 and a tone one cent sharper than A4 is less than the difference in hertz between the two tones 25 cents and 26 cents sharper than A4. The formula that expresses this relationship perfectly is very similar to the one used for assigning frequencies to notes within an octave, and is based on the fact that 2 raised to the 1/1200 power multiplied by itself 100 times = 2 raised to the 1/12 power. In other words, 100 cents = 2100/1200 = 2 1/12 = 1.059463094. So +100 cents from note A becomes A# = 440 x 2 1/12 = 440 1.059463094 = 466.163761 hz. Thus, advancing 1 cent at a time for 100 cents (i.e., a semitone) brings us exactly to the next note in the scale. This formula provides that a tone x cents sharper than any given tone has a frequency equal to that of the given tone multiplied by 2 raised to the x/1200 power. For example, the frequency of a tone 1 cent sharper than A4 is 440 x 2 raised to the 1/1200 power. Similarly, the frequency of a tone 5 cents sharper than A4 has the frequency 440 x 2 raised to the 5/1200 power. Thus, the frequency of a tone 100 cents higher than A4 is 440 x 2 raised to the 100/1200 power, which is the same as 440 x 2 raised to the 1/12 power, which is the formula for the frequency of the next note up the scale, A#. Here is the formula applied to calculate frequencies for some tones various numbers of cents sharper than A4: 1 cent = 21/1200 = 1.000577790. So +1 cents from note A = 440.2542276 hertz 5 cents = 25/1200 = 1.002892288. So +5 cents from note A = 441.2726067 10 cents = 210/1200 = 1.005792941. So +10 cents from note A = 442.548894 15 cents = 215/1200 = 1.008701984. So +15 cents from note A = 443.8288728 To calculate frequencies of tones various numbers of cents flatter than A4, we take the reciprocal. In other words, -1 cent = 1/cent = 1/21/1200 =1/1.000577790 = 0.999422433, so -1 cent from note A = 439.000577567 -5 cents = 1/25/1200 = 1/1.002892288 = 0.997116053. So -5 cents from note A = 438.7310634 -10 cents = 1/210/1200 = 1/1.005792941. So -10 cents from note A = 437.4657865 -15 cents = 1/215/1200 = 1/1.008701984. So -15 cents from note A = 436.2041584 Notice that the number of hertz equating to -5 cents (-1.2883 hz) is not exactly equal to the number of hertz equating to +5 cents (+1.2726 hz), but they are so close (within .0157 hz) that no one would ever hear the difference, not even on musette tuning at the highest notes. That is why it is okay to use the simplified \"cheat sheet\", which uses a single conversion factor for tuning either sharp or flat. No one can hear a .0157 bps difference in beat frequency. Now you know how to calculate the difference in hertz between two notes any given number of cents apart. Since each hertz of difference generates 1 beat per second (bps) when the two notes are played together, you now also know the number of bps that is generated for any given number of cents difference. A very clear, plain language explanation of why each hertz of difference generates one bps can be found in Chapter 27 of PIANO ACCORDION OWNER\u2019S MANUAL AND BUYER\u2019S GUIDE.","title":"Tools and supplies needed for tuning:"},{"location":"owners-manual/","text":"Piano Accordion Owner's Manual and Buyers Guide \"Piano Accordion Owner's Manual and Buyers Guide\" by George Bachich is the accordion book you've been waiting for.

A440 accordion - An accordion in which the lowest A in the clarinet reed set and the second from lowest A in the bassoon set are tuned to 440 Hz. A442 accordion - An accordion in which the lowest A in the clarinet reed set and the second from lowest A in the bassoon set are tuned to 442 Hz. Axle rod - The brass or steel rod on which the treble keys hinge, also commonly called a spindle. The axle rod is as long as the keyboard, and usually about 1.5 mm in diameter. It can usually be accessed from the bottom of the treble keyboard after removing a small metal cover. Full size accordions usually have one axle rod for the black keys and another for the white keys, while many smaller models have all the keys on one axle. Accordions with individually removable keys do not have removable axle rods. Bass button - One of usually 120 buttons mounted on pistons that activate levers that open valves for each note on the bass side of the accordion. Bass cabinet - The (usually celluloid covered) wooden case work on the left side of the bellows (from the reference point of the player) to which the bass machine and bass reed blocks are mounted. Bass cover - A removable wood or metal cover plate over the bass machine. Bass keyboard - The array of bass buttons on the left side of the accordion that play bass notes and chords. Bass machine - An assembly of buttons, pistons, levers, bell cranks, cams, and cam followers that act together to open selected bass valves to play the desired individual notes and chords when bass buttons are pushed. Most bass machines must be disassembled piece by piece to gain access to the bass valves, but some accordions have bass machines that can be removed as an assembly, allowing much faster and easier access to the valves. Bass piston - A metal rod 4 to 6 inches long with a plastic button on top and with 1 to 4 pins protruding from one side which engage levers on bell cranks that open bass note valves when the button is pressed. Note buttons have pistons with just 1 pin for opening just 1 valve, while chord buttons have pistons with 3 or 4 pins to simultaneously open 3 or 4 note valves. Bass pipes - The bell cranks that open the bass valves. Each pipe is a solid metal rod about 12 inches long which has one cam lever to lift its particular note valve open and several other levers to engage pins on the various bass button pistons that use that note. When such a button is pressed, each of the pins on the piston engages one of the levers on the pipe, forcing the pipe to rotate, which in turn causes the cam lever to open the valve. In a Stradella bass machine there are two pipes for each bass note on the accordion, one in the chord set and one in the note set, and thus a total of 24 pipes in an accordion which has all the bass notes, i.e., all 12 notes in the chromatic scale. Bass strap - A 2- to 3-inch wide (usually padded) leather strap on the left side of the accordion used to operate the bellows and to keep the player\u2019s arm in position and within easy reach of the bass buttons. Bass switches - Push-buttons or rockers that operate the bass register slides to control the air flow to each complete set of bass reeds. Bass switches enable the selection of various combinations of bass reed sets. Bass valve - A wood or metal pallet, usually with felt padding and a leather seal that closes ports for an individual bass note. The bass valve is opened (lifted off its port) by the action of levers and cams when certain bass buttons are pressed. Bassoon reeds - The lowest frequency set of treble reeds on the accordion. On a standard accordion this is a set of 41 reeds incorporating all the notes of the chromatic scale from piano F2 to A5. Bps - Beats per second. Bellows - A manually operated air pump, constructed mainly of pleated cardboard, which supplies air to the reeds. Pressure on the bellows controls the volume of the sound. Bellows pin - A short steel nail-like pin that holds the accordion cabinets to the bellows. To inspect the reeds and leathers, the accordion is opened by removing the bellows pins on one side of the bellows and separating the cabinet from the bellows. On each side of the bellows there are usually three pins on the back and three or four in the front, and sometimes one on the top and one on the bottom. Bellows strap - A leather or metal strap that holds the bellows closed. Bellows tape - Vinyl faced cloth tape glued over the folds in the bellows to help strengthen the folds, protect them from abrasion, and enhance the appearance. Castelfidardo - A small city in the Marche region of eastern Italy known for its accordion factories, which produced the vast majority of the accordions found in the United States today. Accordions are still manufactured in Castelfidardo, but on a much smaller scale than fifty years ago. Clarinet reeds - A set of reeds one octave higher than the bassoon reeds. On a standard accordion this set includes all 41 notes on the chromatic scale from piano F3 to A6. Choking - Balking. The refusal by a reed to begin vibrating at the sudden onset of air flow, typically caused by inadequate clearance of the reed tongue tip above the plane of the reed plate. Converter bass - A bass machine that can be switched back and forth between the Stradella and free bass systems. Dry tuning - No tremolo. All reeds tuned to concert pitch. Duraluminum - A hard aluminum alloy used in the manufacture of the best reed plates generally used only in handmade reeds. Foundation plate - The flat wood or metal plate that separates the reed blocks on one side from the valves on the other, and which contains ports under each valve, (and aligned with individual reed chambers in the reed blocks) through which air is allowed to flow when both the register slide and the valve are open. In most accordions the register slides are mounted on the foundation plate under the reed blocks. On the treble foundation plate, one port for each of the treble reed sets is located under each valve. Thus, the number of reed sets can be determined by counting the ports under any treble valve (except in tone chambered accordions, where each key has a second valve in the tone chamber, with one or two of the ports located under that valve). Free bass - A bass machine in which each bass button operates only one note in only one octave, and in which the buttons are arranged in chromatic scale order through up to five octaves. Glissando - Sliding a finger up or down the keyboard to sound a series of notes in rapid succession. Grille - The metal or plastic cover over the treble valves, often incorporating openings for air and sound, which openings are normally covered from the inside by a decorative grille cloth. Hand fitted reeds - The second highest grade of reeds, with some of the features of handmade reeds, most notably tight clearances between the tongue and the vent. Handmade reeds - The highest grade of reeds, made from the best materials and incorporating design features that tend to make them more responsive to less bellows pressure, while also remaining more stable frequency-wise under higher bellows pressure. Handmade reeds are the hallmark of the best quality accordions preferred by professional musicians. Fewer than one percent of accordions have handmade reeds. Hertz - Cycles per second. Individually removable keys - Treble keys that can be removed without first removing the axle rod. This allows removing any single key without having first to remove all other keys between that key and the end of the axle rod. Many accordions with individually removable keys have a small tool for removing or replacing key springs mounted under the treble grille. Keyboard - The part of the accordion to which the treble keys are mounted. The term often also includes those keys. Key rod - The metal extension on the back of each treble key which extends out over the valve port, and to which the pallet is fixed with either plastic or wax. LM - An accordion with 1 set of bassoon reeds and 1 set of clarinet reeds. LMH - An accordion with 1 set of bassoon reeds, 1 set of clarinet reeds, and 1 set of piccolo reeds. LMM - An accordion with 1 set of bassoon reeds and 2 sets of clarinet reeds. LMMH - An accordion with 1 set of bassoon reeds, 2 sets of clarinet reeds, and 1 set of piccolo reeds. LMMM - An accordion with 1 set of bassoon reeds and 3 sets of clarinet reeds. LMMMH - An accordion with 1 set of bassoon reeds, 3 sets of clarinet reeds, and 1 set of piccolo reeds. MM - An accordion with 2 sets of clarinet reeds. MMM - An accordion with 3 sets of clarinet reeds. Musette reeds - A second and/or third set of clarinet reeds tuned slightly off pitch to create a tremolo effect. Musette tuning - A tremolo effect achieved by playing two or three reeds for the same note, each of which is tuned to a very slightly different frequency. Mute - To soften or mellow the sound. Mute chamber - An enclosure under the treble grille that mutes the sound of the treble reeds. Hinged doors or sliding doors can typically be opened to unmute the reeds. Pallet - The wood or metal foot on the treble key rod or bass valve which lifts off the port when a key or button is pressed, allowing air to flow over the reed behind it. The pallet is fitted with a leather seal, often with a felt cushion between the leather valve face and the pallet. The pallet is connected to the key rod or valve lever with reed wax, or sometimes with a plastic sleeve fixed to the pallet which fits snugly over the key rod. Piccolo reeds - The highest frequency set of reeds available on a standard accordion, one octave higher than the clarinet set, and incorporating all the notes of the chromatic scale from F4 to A7. Ports - The round or square openings in the foundation plate which allow air flow to be directed over the single reed aligned with each port. A valve opens its ports when the key or button for that particular note is pressed. Reed - An assembly comprised of 1 reed plate, 2 reed tongues, 2 rivets, and usually 2 reed leathers. Reed blocks - The interior wooden racks that hold the reeds in place over their respective ports and valves. Usually, each full set of treble reeds (41 in most accordions) is split across two reed blocks, one mounted closer to the treble keyboard to house the black key notes in that set, and another mounted farther away to house the white key notes, although space limitations in some designs require two or three of the white key notes to be located in the black key reed block. In some older designs, the register slides are mounted in the reed blocks, while in later designs they are mounted in the foundation plate to which the reed block is mounted. On the bass side, each reed block holds one full set of 12 bass reeds on each side of the block, so each bass reed block can contain up to two complete sets of reeds. Each reed block is divided into small chambers, with one chamber per reed, each chamber being proportional in size to the reed that is mounted to it. Reed plate - An aluminum (or duraluminum) plate with two long narrow slots in it and with rivet holes for the attachment of two reed tongues, each free to vibrate in one of the slots in response to air flow. Reed tongue - A spring steel blade riveted to a reed plate. The reed tongue vibrates at a certain frequency when air is forced to flow through the reed. Reed vent - The slot in the reed plate. Reed wax - A mixture of mostly beeswax, but also containing some rosin and a bit of linseed oil, which is used to anchor and seal the reed plates to the reed blocks. It is also often used to fasten the pallets to the treble key rods and to the bass valve levers. Register slides - Thin flat strips of steel or brass approximately 1/2 inch wide x as long as the reed blocks, i.e., 13 to 17 inches long, containing a series of square holes, one hole for each note in the reed block, i.e., one for each valve port. In response to switch movement, the slides slide end-wise to align all the holes with their ports to enable air flow through that set of reeds, or alternatively to close off the ports to disallow air flow through that set of reeds. Spindle - Treble key axle rod Stradella bass - The most common type of bass machine, in which the buttons for root notes and their chord families are arranged according to the circle of fifths, and in which each individual note button plays that note in up to five octaves at once, depending on bass switch settings. Tone chamber - A resonant box of wood or metal to which one or two reed blocks are mounted for the purpose of enhancing the sound emanating from those reeds. On tone chamber accordions, a second set of treble valves operates inside the tone chamber to control those reeds mounted to the chamber. Thus, on tone chamber accordions there are two treble valves attached to each treble key. Treble cabinet - The (usually celluloid covered) wooden case work on the right hand side of the bellows (from the reference point of the player), to which the treble keyboard, the treble reed blocks, and one side of the bellows are attached. Treble key - One of usually 41 piano-like keys on the treble side of the accordion. Treble keyboard - The (usually 41) piano style treble keys and the wooden platform that supports them. The keyboard assembly also includes metal axle rods that run through the keys and the platform, as well as felt cushions under the keys. Treble switches - Buttons or levers that operate the treble register slides to control the air flow to each complete set of treble reeds. Often, one switch moves two or more register slides simultaneously to enable the selection of various combinations of reed sets. Treble valve - A wood or metal pallet, usually with felt padding and a leather seal that closes two to four ports for an individual note (the number of ports depends on the number of treble reed sets in the accordion and whether some of those reed sets are mounted to a tone chamber). The pallet and its felt and leather seal are attached to a treble key rod and are lifted off the port when that treble key is pressed. Tremolo beat - The slow harmonic frequency generated by two reeds vibrating at nearly the same pitch. The frequency of the tremolo beat is equal to the number of hertz of difference between the two primary frequencies. Thus, if two reeds are tuned n Hertz apart, they will generate a tremolo beat of n beats per second when played together. Ventilli - Thin flexible plastic reed valves. Voicing - The adjustment of the clearance of the tip of the reed tongue above the plane of the reed plate to the optimum clearance for rapid response to air flow without choking. Chapter 10. Weight Smaller accordions tend to weigh less, so you might want a smaller accordion just for its lighter weight, especially if you play standing up. Standard full-size 4/5 accordions usually weigh between 22 and 28 pounds, while ladies'-size 3/4 accordions generally weigh between 16 and 20 pounds. The weight difference can be significant if you play standing or strolling for long periods. If you always sit down to play, the accordion rests on your lap, making instrument weight much less of an issue. Naturally, 2-reed accordions tend to be lighter than 3-reed accordions, which in turn tend to be lighter than 4-reed accordions. However, this is not always the case, so you should actually compare the weights. The really old accordions tend to be lighter than more recent models. However, the later models were made heavier for good reason. Some of the older ones were so light and flimsy that they did not hold up well, and tended to warp and flex, sometimes causing air leaks around the valves that are difficult to seal. The really old ones (prior to 1940) also have very deep key action and nearly square edges on the keys, making them difficult to play. They require extensive keyboard modifications to make them easier to play and to give them a more modern feel. Nevertheless, once these modifications are made, playing one of these antiques can be very satisfying for people who appreciate old instruments, and they offer the additional advantage of lighter weight. When comparing accordion weights, be sure to understand whether strap weight is being included. A standard set of wide padded shoulder straps weighs about 1 1/4 pounds and can skew your comparisons. Finally, notice that balance can be as important as weight. An accordion that hangs comfortably can feel lighter and actually be less of a strain on your back than a lighter one that does not feel so well balanced. The bottom line is that rather than just weighing it, you have to try the accordion on and play it standing up for a while to see how heavy it feels compared to others. We all want an accordion that weighs under 15 pounds, but we have to compromise in order to get other features we want. 12-bass accordions weigh under 15 pounds, but offer limited utility. Some 48 to 96 bass accordions now being manufactured (mostly 2-reed) fall within or close to that weight limit, but offer limited switching options, smaller keyboards (fewer keys), and unknown durability. Some people like the sound they produce, and some don't. If light weight is important to you, then one of these accordions might be the right choice. Light weight always comes at a price. Lighter cabinet construction using lighter and thinner wood impacts tonal qualities, rigidity, and durability. Fewer buttons, keys, and reed sets adversely impact flexibility in the type of music you can play, as well as the tonal options available. Narrower keys can make it difficult for people with wide fingers to play. Designers of the smallest accordions generally tune them very wet to get more sound out of a smaller box. Although they may sound bright and cheery, this excessively wet tuning can eventually get on your nerves. Every design is a compromise. Finding the right compromise for you is a very personal decision. This guide will help you understand the options and trade-offs available, to enable you to make the right decision. Chapter 11. Reed Quality Reeds are the heart of any accordion, and \u201chandmade reeds\u201d (\u201cvoce a mano\u201d in Italian) are the hallmark of the very best accordions. They generally respond better at lower bellows pressure (playing softly), tolerate higher pressures (louder volume) with less frequency distortion, and produce a better, fuller sound. However, handmade reeds are relatively expensive, and accordions with handmade reeds command significantly higher prices. There is much confusion about handmade reeds. Some people think they may not really be handmade at all, that the name is just a label used to denote the higher manufacturing standards applied to the highest quality reeds. Some feel that since today\u2019s handmade reeds are partly made by machine, they are therefore not really handmade in the old tradition, and should be called hand fitted. Some people point out that handmade reeds are not necessarily any better than other reeds because the quality obviously depends on the skill of the hands that make them. Many accordion players do not hear or feel a significant difference between some handmade reeds and the next grade down (hand fitted reeds, or \u201cvoce tipo a mano\u201d in Italian). Some even say the best hand fitted reeds might even be better than some handmade reeds, and this is probably true. However, in some cases the difference is undeniable. The reed response on the accordion I tried out at the Beltuna factory in Castelfidardo was astounding. It was unequivocally better than on any other accordion I have ever played, including my Giulietti Super, which also has handmade reeds. The lesson here is that quality varies, even among handmade reeds. To evaluate the quality and condition of any accordion, you must play it and compare it to other accordions. You cannot rely on unsupported claims of high quality, and you cannot infer superior quality solely from brand names or from claims that an accordion has handmade reeds. To evaluate the reeds, check for response at very low bellows pressure and for frequency stability at very high bellows pressure. The lowest notes in the bassoon set are the most sensitive to both of these tests. Squeeze or pull the bellows very gently and see if the note will play. The softer you can play these notes and the less air they use, the better the quality. Also see how loudly the reeds will play without going flat. Better frequency stability at higher bellows pressure indicates better quality reeds. This may be due to the harder aluminium reed plate allowing a tighter rivet connection between the reed tongue and the reed plate. Test several reeds, though, because reed response is also highly dependent on reed voicing (the adjustment of the elevation of the tip of the reed tongue above the plane of the reed plate), as well as on the condition of the leathers. If some of the lowest frequency reeds seem highly responsive and some don\u2019t, it could be because some of them are not properly voiced or because their leathers are bad. If any of them choke (refuse to sound or delay sounding under sudden high bellows pressure), they will need to be properly voiced before you can meaningfully test them. The advantages of handmade reeds are most apparent at the low end of the keyboard because it is here that machine made reeds reveal their greatest weaknesses. The lowest notes emanate from the largest reeds, which have greater mass, requiring more air to get them moving. Due to their larger size, they also have a greater distance around the perimeter of the reed tongue, and thus more space for air to leak between the reed tongue and the vent rather than driving it. These two factors, 1) more air required to drive the reed and 2) less of the available air being put to work driving it, compound to make the lowest note reeds the least responsive on our keyboards. That's why you need more bellows pressure to play the lowest notes in the bassoon reed set. It is here that handmade reeds are most needed and where they have the greatest advantage. Comparing a Binci handmade reed to a machine made reed at the lowest F in the bassoon reed set reveals striking differences in thickness and contour that allow the Binci reed to be lighter than the machine made reed. The machine made reed is of nearly uniform thickness along its length, while the Binci reed is very thin near the fixed end and steps up in thickness twice as we approach the free end. This design puts the centre of gravity closer to the tip than it would be on a similar length reed tongue of nearly constant thickness, thus allowing the Binci reed to be significantly thinner near the fixed end, and therefore lighter, while still vibrating at the assigned frequency. The clearance between the reed tongue and the vent is smaller on the Binci reed, reducing the air loss around the tongue and putting more of the available air to work driving the reed. Perhaps due to its lower mass, as well as to less leakage, the Binci reed is also properly voiced using a noticeably smaller elevation of the tip of the reed tongue above the reed plate. This probably further reduces the air loss around the reed tongue, thereby helping to make the Binci reed more responsive. I also compared the Binci handmade reeds to the handmade reeds in my Giulietti Super, and the Binci reed appears to have advantages, primarily in lighter weight, lending further credence to the notion that not all handmade reeds are equal. While it is probably true that some hand fitted reeds are better than some handmade reeds, I doubt that there are hand fitted reeds that can match the responsiveness of the Binci handmade reeds. If there are, I would like to see them. For a more complete explanation of how handmade reeds can be so much better, and very clear instructions on how to recognize them, supported by close-up colour photographs comparing handmade reeds to machine made reeds, see the technical discussion in Chapter 26. Chapter 28. Proper Care Now that you have found your accordion, how can you take proper care of it? There are some things you should know. Reed wax melts at 140 degrees, so if you leave your accordion in your car parked in the hot summer sun, you can expect the wax to melt, allowing some reeds to sag out of place, making the accordion unplayable until costly repairs are made. Don\u2019t let your accordion get too hot. Moisture condenses on cold metal parts, so if you move your accordion from a really cold place into a warm room and begin playing it, you can expect moisture to condense on the reeds, causing damage. For instance if you were recently playing it outdoors on a cold winter day and you subsequently move into a warm room full of moisture breathing people and start playing it, you will be drawing warm moist air over cold metal reeds. If the temperature of the reeds is below the dew point of the air, moisture will condense on the cold reeds, causing corrosion that will put the reeds out of tune and perhaps damage them irreparably. If your accordion is really cold, bring it inside and leave it closed tightly in its case (sealed away from moisture) for several hours (as long as it takes for it to warm up nearly to room temperature), before you play it. Salt air is corrosive to reeds and other metal parts, so if you play your accordion at the beach or on your saltwater boat, you can expect the reeds and other metal parts to corrode. Never play your accordion in a salt air environment unless you consider the accordion expendable. Moisture is the enemy of wood and leather, so always keep your accordion in a dry place, and never play it in the rain or fog. Never wash your accordion or keyboard in a manner that might allow any liquid to run or drip into it or under the keys, and never spray any liquid on it. The plastic exterior of your accordion and the buttons and keys can be cleaned with a soft cloth slightly dampened in piano key cleaner. If that does not work, dampen the cloth in rubbing alcohol. Never use acetone, lacquer thinner, or other harsh chemicals, as they will attack and dull the plastic finish. Bass straps are anchored to the accordion with light duty rivets not intended to support the weight of the accordion, so never lift your accordion by the bass strap, or the rivets may fail, causing you to drop the accordion and damage it. It\u2019s okay to lift it by the shoulder straps and carry it suitcase-fashion as long as you are careful not to let a strap get under the edge of a key and bend it up. Your accordion should be kept out of its case in a warm dry room, on a bookshelf or table, and unless it has a tone chamber, it should be resting on its feet (the four feet on the bass plate) with a dust cover over it. In this position all the reed leathers are aligned vertically and are thus less likely to sag away from their reed plates. Nearly as good, from the leathers\u2019 point of view, is to keep it in playing position, which at least puts the strong axis of the leathers (the width, rather than the thickness) in opposition to gravity, making them unlikely to sag. The worst position is lying flat with the tops of the keys upward (or downward), because this puts half the leathers in the position where gravity is most likely to cause them to sag away from their reed plates, and they definitely will. If your accordion has a tone chamber, it is best to store it in playing position, as resting it on its feet would put half the leathers in the tone chamber in the position most likely to cause sagging. This may be why Giulietti used to put a handle on one end of its hard cases in addition to the one between the latches. Standing the case on its end puts the accordion into playing position. Keeping your accordion out of its case will contribute to its health and longevity if it encourages you to pick it up and play it more often. However, when you transport your accordion, it should be in its case for better protection against bumps and scratches. Accordion case latches are notorious for coming unlatched at inopportune times, so always carry your hard case with the lid toward your leg so if it pops open the lid will hit your leg, rather than your accordion hitting the pavement. When you transport your accordion by car, the best position is with the case handle up, as this has the accordion resting on its feet, well positioned to tolerate any bumps. However, if you think it might tip over going around a curve or during a sudden start or stop, then it is better to place it with the case lid down, so the treble keys and, most importantly, the bass buttons face downward. This is so that if you hit a big bump the bass buttons won\u2019t all submerge. If the buttons are facing upward and you hit a big bump, the buttons can submerge into their holes and not come back up, requiring a costly repair. Disuse encourages decay. Storing an accordion for long periods subjects it to possible damage from mildew, moths, and corrosion, and allows leathers to sag and curl back from the reed plates. Accordions should be played regularly. Regularly flushing the inside of the accordion with fresh air by playing it discourages mildew, moths, and corrosion. Playing also flexes the leathers and helps keep them soft and flat against the reed plates. Shoulder strap adjustment is essential to proper playing technique and your health and comfort. The left shoulder strap should be several inches shorter than the right. Both straps should be adjusted so the accordion sits well to the left of centre, putting the black treble keys directly below your chin and the top of the accordion about four inches below your chin. In standing position with your right hand on the keyboard, your right wrist straight, your right elbow slightly raised and straight out to your side, and your right shoulder relaxed (not raised and not pulled to the rear), the finger tips of your right hand should just reach the inboard ends of the black keys. If you find yourself playing with your right shoulder pulled back or raised, or with your right elbow down and/or rearward, or with your right wrist bent, then your accordion is probably too far to the right. If you experience fatigue or pain in your right wrist, elbow, or shoulder, your accordion is probably too far to the right. If you position your accordion properly, you will experience less fatigue and be more likely to play often, which will help keep your accordion in good condition. Not all bellows pins are the same size. They may vary in diameter by 1/1000 inch or more, which can make a difference in how they fit, so when you take them out, keep them in order so they will go back into the same holes. If you inadvertently mix them up, make sure you don\u2019t force any of them until you are sure you have the best fit. Forcing the largest pin into the smallest hole may enlarge it, while leaving you with a smaller pin fitting too loosely in the largest hole. Accordions are fragile. If you must ship your accordion, pack it carefully. First immobilize the bass buttons by removing the bass cover and inserting strips of folded cardboard under the bottoms of the pistons to prevent them from moving downward and possibly submerging the buttons. Be sure to advise the recipient on how to remove the cardboard. Wrap the accordion in bubble wrap and put it in its case. Wrap the case in bubble wrap and put it in a tight fitting box. Tape the box well and label it \u201cFragile musical instrument. Do not drop.\u201d If traveling by airline, never check your accordion as baggage. To protect it from damage, put it in a soft case (or no case so people will see and respect its fragility) and make it your carry-on.","title":"Piano Accordion Owner's Manual & Buyers Guide"},{"location":"owners-manual/#piano-accordion-owners-manual-and-buyers-guide","text":"\"Piano Accordion Owner's Manual and Buyers Guide\" by George Bachich is the accordion book you've been waiting for.

A440 accordion - An accordion in which the lowest A in the clarinet reed set and the second from lowest A in the bassoon set are tuned to 440 Hz. A442 accordion - An accordion in which the lowest A in the clarinet reed set and the second from lowest A in the bassoon set are tuned to 442 Hz. Axle rod - The brass or steel rod on which the treble keys hinge, also commonly called a spindle. The axle rod is as long as the keyboard, and usually about 1.5 mm in diameter. It can usually be accessed from the bottom of the treble keyboard after removing a small metal cover. Full size accordions usually have one axle rod for the black keys and another for the white keys, while many smaller models have all the keys on one axle. Accordions with individually removable keys do not have removable axle rods. Bass button - One of usually 120 buttons mounted on pistons that activate levers that open valves for each note on the bass side of the accordion. Bass cabinet - The (usually celluloid covered) wooden case work on the left side of the bellows (from the reference point of the player) to which the bass machine and bass reed blocks are mounted. Bass cover - A removable wood or metal cover plate over the bass machine. Bass keyboard - The array of bass buttons on the left side of the accordion that play bass notes and chords. Bass machine - An assembly of buttons, pistons, levers, bell cranks, cams, and cam followers that act together to open selected bass valves to play the desired individual notes and chords when bass buttons are pushed. Most bass machines must be disassembled piece by piece to gain access to the bass valves, but some accordions have bass machines that can be removed as an assembly, allowing much faster and easier access to the valves. Bass piston - A metal rod 4 to 6 inches long with a plastic button on top and with 1 to 4 pins protruding from one side which engage levers on bell cranks that open bass note valves when the button is pressed. Note buttons have pistons with just 1 pin for opening just 1 valve, while chord buttons have pistons with 3 or 4 pins to simultaneously open 3 or 4 note valves. Bass pipes - The bell cranks that open the bass valves. Each pipe is a solid metal rod about 12 inches long which has one cam lever to lift its particular note valve open and several other levers to engage pins on the various bass button pistons that use that note. When such a button is pressed, each of the pins on the piston engages one of the levers on the pipe, forcing the pipe to rotate, which in turn causes the cam lever to open the valve. In a Stradella bass machine there are two pipes for each bass note on the accordion, one in the chord set and one in the note set, and thus a total of 24 pipes in an accordion which has all the bass notes, i.e., all 12 notes in the chromatic scale. Bass strap - A 2- to 3-inch wide (usually padded) leather strap on the left side of the accordion used to operate the bellows and to keep the player\u2019s arm in position and within easy reach of the bass buttons. Bass switches - Push-buttons or rockers that operate the bass register slides to control the air flow to each complete set of bass reeds. Bass switches enable the selection of various combinations of bass reed sets. Bass valve - A wood or metal pallet, usually with felt padding and a leather seal that closes ports for an individual bass note. The bass valve is opened (lifted off its port) by the action of levers and cams when certain bass buttons are pressed. Bassoon reeds - The lowest frequency set of treble reeds on the accordion. On a standard accordion this is a set of 41 reeds incorporating all the notes of the chromatic scale from piano F2 to A5. Bps - Beats per second. Bellows - A manually operated air pump, constructed mainly of pleated cardboard, which supplies air to the reeds. Pressure on the bellows controls the volume of the sound. Bellows pin - A short steel nail-like pin that holds the accordion cabinets to the bellows. To inspect the reeds and leathers, the accordion is opened by removing the bellows pins on one side of the bellows and separating the cabinet from the bellows. On each side of the bellows there are usually three pins on the back and three or four in the front, and sometimes one on the top and one on the bottom. Bellows strap - A leather or metal strap that holds the bellows closed. Bellows tape - Vinyl faced cloth tape glued over the folds in the bellows to help strengthen the folds, protect them from abrasion, and enhance the appearance. Castelfidardo - A small city in the Marche region of eastern Italy known for its accordion factories, which produced the vast majority of the accordions found in the United States today. Accordions are still manufactured in Castelfidardo, but on a much smaller scale than fifty years ago. Clarinet reeds - A set of reeds one octave higher than the bassoon reeds. On a standard accordion this set includes all 41 notes on the chromatic scale from piano F3 to A6. Choking - Balking. The refusal by a reed to begin vibrating at the sudden onset of air flow, typically caused by inadequate clearance of the reed tongue tip above the plane of the reed plate. Converter bass - A bass machine that can be switched back and forth between the Stradella and free bass systems. Dry tuning - No tremolo. All reeds tuned to concert pitch. Duraluminum - A hard aluminum alloy used in the manufacture of the best reed plates generally used only in handmade reeds. Foundation plate - The flat wood or metal plate that separates the reed blocks on one side from the valves on the other, and which contains ports under each valve, (and aligned with individual reed chambers in the reed blocks) through which air is allowed to flow when both the register slide and the valve are open. In most accordions the register slides are mounted on the foundation plate under the reed blocks. On the treble foundation plate, one port for each of the treble reed sets is located under each valve. Thus, the number of reed sets can be determined by counting the ports under any treble valve (except in tone chambered accordions, where each key has a second valve in the tone chamber, with one or two of the ports located under that valve). Free bass - A bass machine in which each bass button operates only one note in only one octave, and in which the buttons are arranged in chromatic scale order through up to five octaves. Glissando - Sliding a finger up or down the keyboard to sound a series of notes in rapid succession. Grille - The metal or plastic cover over the treble valves, often incorporating openings for air and sound, which openings are normally covered from the inside by a decorative grille cloth. Hand fitted reeds - The second highest grade of reeds, with some of the features of handmade reeds, most notably tight clearances between the tongue and the vent. Handmade reeds - The highest grade of reeds, made from the best materials and incorporating design features that tend to make them more responsive to less bellows pressure, while also remaining more stable frequency-wise under higher bellows pressure. Handmade reeds are the hallmark of the best quality accordions preferred by professional musicians. Fewer than one percent of accordions have handmade reeds. Hertz - Cycles per second. Individually removable keys - Treble keys that can be removed without first removing the axle rod. This allows removing any single key without having first to remove all other keys between that key and the end of the axle rod. Many accordions with individually removable keys have a small tool for removing or replacing key springs mounted under the treble grille. Keyboard - The part of the accordion to which the treble keys are mounted. The term often also includes those keys. Key rod - The metal extension on the back of each treble key which extends out over the valve port, and to which the pallet is fixed with either plastic or wax. LM - An accordion with 1 set of bassoon reeds and 1 set of clarinet reeds. LMH - An accordion with 1 set of bassoon reeds, 1 set of clarinet reeds, and 1 set of piccolo reeds. LMM - An accordion with 1 set of bassoon reeds and 2 sets of clarinet reeds. LMMH - An accordion with 1 set of bassoon reeds, 2 sets of clarinet reeds, and 1 set of piccolo reeds. LMMM - An accordion with 1 set of bassoon reeds and 3 sets of clarinet reeds. LMMMH - An accordion with 1 set of bassoon reeds, 3 sets of clarinet reeds, and 1 set of piccolo reeds. MM - An accordion with 2 sets of clarinet reeds. MMM - An accordion with 3 sets of clarinet reeds. Musette reeds - A second and/or third set of clarinet reeds tuned slightly off pitch to create a tremolo effect. Musette tuning - A tremolo effect achieved by playing two or three reeds for the same note, each of which is tuned to a very slightly different frequency. Mute - To soften or mellow the sound. Mute chamber - An enclosure under the treble grille that mutes the sound of the treble reeds. Hinged doors or sliding doors can typically be opened to unmute the reeds. Pallet - The wood or metal foot on the treble key rod or bass valve which lifts off the port when a key or button is pressed, allowing air to flow over the reed behind it. The pallet is fitted with a leather seal, often with a felt cushion between the leather valve face and the pallet. The pallet is connected to the key rod or valve lever with reed wax, or sometimes with a plastic sleeve fixed to the pallet which fits snugly over the key rod. Piccolo reeds - The highest frequency set of reeds available on a standard accordion, one octave higher than the clarinet set, and incorporating all the notes of the chromatic scale from F4 to A7. Ports - The round or square openings in the foundation plate which allow air flow to be directed over the single reed aligned with each port. A valve opens its ports when the key or button for that particular note is pressed. Reed - An assembly comprised of 1 reed plate, 2 reed tongues, 2 rivets, and usually 2 reed leathers. Reed blocks - The interior wooden racks that hold the reeds in place over their respective ports and valves. Usually, each full set of treble reeds (41 in most accordions) is split across two reed blocks, one mounted closer to the treble keyboard to house the black key notes in that set, and another mounted farther away to house the white key notes, although space limitations in some designs require two or three of the white key notes to be located in the black key reed block. In some older designs, the register slides are mounted in the reed blocks, while in later designs they are mounted in the foundation plate to which the reed block is mounted. On the bass side, each reed block holds one full set of 12 bass reeds on each side of the block, so each bass reed block can contain up to two complete sets of reeds. Each reed block is divided into small chambers, with one chamber per reed, each chamber being proportional in size to the reed that is mounted to it. Reed plate - An aluminum (or duraluminum) plate with two long narrow slots in it and with rivet holes for the attachment of two reed tongues, each free to vibrate in one of the slots in response to air flow. Reed tongue - A spring steel blade riveted to a reed plate. The reed tongue vibrates at a certain frequency when air is forced to flow through the reed. Reed vent - The slot in the reed plate. Reed wax - A mixture of mostly beeswax, but also containing some rosin and a bit of linseed oil, which is used to anchor and seal the reed plates to the reed blocks. It is also often used to fasten the pallets to the treble key rods and to the bass valve levers. Register slides - Thin flat strips of steel or brass approximately 1/2 inch wide x as long as the reed blocks, i.e., 13 to 17 inches long, containing a series of square holes, one hole for each note in the reed block, i.e., one for each valve port. In response to switch movement, the slides slide end-wise to align all the holes with their ports to enable air flow through that set of reeds, or alternatively to close off the ports to disallow air flow through that set of reeds. Spindle - Treble key axle rod Stradella bass - The most common type of bass machine, in which the buttons for root notes and their chord families are arranged according to the circle of fifths, and in which each individual note button plays that note in up to five octaves at once, depending on bass switch settings. Tone chamber - A resonant box of wood or metal to which one or two reed blocks are mounted for the purpose of enhancing the sound emanating from those reeds. On tone chamber accordions, a second set of treble valves operates inside the tone chamber to control those reeds mounted to the chamber. Thus, on tone chamber accordions there are two treble valves attached to each treble key. Treble cabinet - The (usually celluloid covered) wooden case work on the right hand side of the bellows (from the reference point of the player), to which the treble keyboard, the treble reed blocks, and one side of the bellows are attached. Treble key - One of usually 41 piano-like keys on the treble side of the accordion. Treble keyboard - The (usually 41) piano style treble keys and the wooden platform that supports them. The keyboard assembly also includes metal axle rods that run through the keys and the platform, as well as felt cushions under the keys. Treble switches - Buttons or levers that operate the treble register slides to control the air flow to each complete set of treble reeds. Often, one switch moves two or more register slides simultaneously to enable the selection of various combinations of reed sets. Treble valve - A wood or metal pallet, usually with felt padding and a leather seal that closes two to four ports for an individual note (the number of ports depends on the number of treble reed sets in the accordion and whether some of those reed sets are mounted to a tone chamber). The pallet and its felt and leather seal are attached to a treble key rod and are lifted off the port when that treble key is pressed. Tremolo beat - The slow harmonic frequency generated by two reeds vibrating at nearly the same pitch. The frequency of the tremolo beat is equal to the number of hertz of difference between the two primary frequencies. Thus, if two reeds are tuned n Hertz apart, they will generate a tremolo beat of n beats per second when played together. Ventilli - Thin flexible plastic reed valves. Voicing - The adjustment of the clearance of the tip of the reed tongue above the plane of the reed plate to the optimum clearance for rapid response to air flow without choking.","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"owners-manual/#chapter-10-weight","text":"Smaller accordions tend to weigh less, so you might want a smaller accordion just for its lighter weight, especially if you play standing up. Standard full-size 4/5 accordions usually weigh between 22 and 28 pounds, while ladies'-size 3/4 accordions generally weigh between 16 and 20 pounds. The weight difference can be significant if you play standing or strolling for long periods. If you always sit down to play, the accordion rests on your lap, making instrument weight much less of an issue. Naturally, 2-reed accordions tend to be lighter than 3-reed accordions, which in turn tend to be lighter than 4-reed accordions. However, this is not always the case, so you should actually compare the weights. The really old accordions tend to be lighter than more recent models. However, the later models were made heavier for good reason. Some of the older ones were so light and flimsy that they did not hold up well, and tended to warp and flex, sometimes causing air leaks around the valves that are difficult to seal. The really old ones (prior to 1940) also have very deep key action and nearly square edges on the keys, making them difficult to play. They require extensive keyboard modifications to make them easier to play and to give them a more modern feel. Nevertheless, once these modifications are made, playing one of these antiques can be very satisfying for people who appreciate old instruments, and they offer the additional advantage of lighter weight. When comparing accordion weights, be sure to understand whether strap weight is being included. A standard set of wide padded shoulder straps weighs about 1 1/4 pounds and can skew your comparisons. Finally, notice that balance can be as important as weight. An accordion that hangs comfortably can feel lighter and actually be less of a strain on your back than a lighter one that does not feel so well balanced. The bottom line is that rather than just weighing it, you have to try the accordion on and play it standing up for a while to see how heavy it feels compared to others. We all want an accordion that weighs under 15 pounds, but we have to compromise in order to get other features we want. 12-bass accordions weigh under 15 pounds, but offer limited utility. Some 48 to 96 bass accordions now being manufactured (mostly 2-reed) fall within or close to that weight limit, but offer limited switching options, smaller keyboards (fewer keys), and unknown durability. Some people like the sound they produce, and some don't. If light weight is important to you, then one of these accordions might be the right choice. Light weight always comes at a price. Lighter cabinet construction using lighter and thinner wood impacts tonal qualities, rigidity, and durability. Fewer buttons, keys, and reed sets adversely impact flexibility in the type of music you can play, as well as the tonal options available. Narrower keys can make it difficult for people with wide fingers to play. Designers of the smallest accordions generally tune them very wet to get more sound out of a smaller box. Although they may sound bright and cheery, this excessively wet tuning can eventually get on your nerves. Every design is a compromise. Finding the right compromise for you is a very personal decision. This guide will help you understand the options and trade-offs available, to enable you to make the right decision.","title":"Chapter 10. Weight"},{"location":"owners-manual/#chapter-11-reed-quality","text":"Reeds are the heart of any accordion, and \u201chandmade reeds\u201d (\u201cvoce a mano\u201d in Italian) are the hallmark of the very best accordions. They generally respond better at lower bellows pressure (playing softly), tolerate higher pressures (louder volume) with less frequency distortion, and produce a better, fuller sound. However, handmade reeds are relatively expensive, and accordions with handmade reeds command significantly higher prices. There is much confusion about handmade reeds. Some people think they may not really be handmade at all, that the name is just a label used to denote the higher manufacturing standards applied to the highest quality reeds. Some feel that since today\u2019s handmade reeds are partly made by machine, they are therefore not really handmade in the old tradition, and should be called hand fitted. Some people point out that handmade reeds are not necessarily any better than other reeds because the quality obviously depends on the skill of the hands that make them. Many accordion players do not hear or feel a significant difference between some handmade reeds and the next grade down (hand fitted reeds, or \u201cvoce tipo a mano\u201d in Italian). Some even say the best hand fitted reeds might even be better than some handmade reeds, and this is probably true. However, in some cases the difference is undeniable. The reed response on the accordion I tried out at the Beltuna factory in Castelfidardo was astounding. It was unequivocally better than on any other accordion I have ever played, including my Giulietti Super, which also has handmade reeds. The lesson here is that quality varies, even among handmade reeds. To evaluate the quality and condition of any accordion, you must play it and compare it to other accordions. You cannot rely on unsupported claims of high quality, and you cannot infer superior quality solely from brand names or from claims that an accordion has handmade reeds. To evaluate the reeds, check for response at very low bellows pressure and for frequency stability at very high bellows pressure. The lowest notes in the bassoon set are the most sensitive to both of these tests. Squeeze or pull the bellows very gently and see if the note will play. The softer you can play these notes and the less air they use, the better the quality. Also see how loudly the reeds will play without going flat. Better frequency stability at higher bellows pressure indicates better quality reeds. This may be due to the harder aluminium reed plate allowing a tighter rivet connection between the reed tongue and the reed plate. Test several reeds, though, because reed response is also highly dependent on reed voicing (the adjustment of the elevation of the tip of the reed tongue above the plane of the reed plate), as well as on the condition of the leathers. If some of the lowest frequency reeds seem highly responsive and some don\u2019t, it could be because some of them are not properly voiced or because their leathers are bad. If any of them choke (refuse to sound or delay sounding under sudden high bellows pressure), they will need to be properly voiced before you can meaningfully test them. The advantages of handmade reeds are most apparent at the low end of the keyboard because it is here that machine made reeds reveal their greatest weaknesses. The lowest notes emanate from the largest reeds, which have greater mass, requiring more air to get them moving. Due to their larger size, they also have a greater distance around the perimeter of the reed tongue, and thus more space for air to leak between the reed tongue and the vent rather than driving it. These two factors, 1) more air required to drive the reed and 2) less of the available air being put to work driving it, compound to make the lowest note reeds the least responsive on our keyboards. That's why you need more bellows pressure to play the lowest notes in the bassoon reed set. It is here that handmade reeds are most needed and where they have the greatest advantage. Comparing a Binci handmade reed to a machine made reed at the lowest F in the bassoon reed set reveals striking differences in thickness and contour that allow the Binci reed to be lighter than the machine made reed. The machine made reed is of nearly uniform thickness along its length, while the Binci reed is very thin near the fixed end and steps up in thickness twice as we approach the free end. This design puts the centre of gravity closer to the tip than it would be on a similar length reed tongue of nearly constant thickness, thus allowing the Binci reed to be significantly thinner near the fixed end, and therefore lighter, while still vibrating at the assigned frequency. The clearance between the reed tongue and the vent is smaller on the Binci reed, reducing the air loss around the tongue and putting more of the available air to work driving the reed. Perhaps due to its lower mass, as well as to less leakage, the Binci reed is also properly voiced using a noticeably smaller elevation of the tip of the reed tongue above the reed plate. This probably further reduces the air loss around the reed tongue, thereby helping to make the Binci reed more responsive. I also compared the Binci handmade reeds to the handmade reeds in my Giulietti Super, and the Binci reed appears to have advantages, primarily in lighter weight, lending further credence to the notion that not all handmade reeds are equal. While it is probably true that some hand fitted reeds are better than some handmade reeds, I doubt that there are hand fitted reeds that can match the responsiveness of the Binci handmade reeds. If there are, I would like to see them. For a more complete explanation of how handmade reeds can be so much better, and very clear instructions on how to recognize them, supported by close-up colour photographs comparing handmade reeds to machine made reeds, see the technical discussion in Chapter 26.","title":"Chapter 11. Reed Quality"},{"location":"owners-manual/#chapter-28-proper-care","text":"Now that you have found your accordion, how can you take proper care of it? There are some things you should know. Reed wax melts at 140 degrees, so if you leave your accordion in your car parked in the hot summer sun, you can expect the wax to melt, allowing some reeds to sag out of place, making the accordion unplayable until costly repairs are made. Don\u2019t let your accordion get too hot. Moisture condenses on cold metal parts, so if you move your accordion from a really cold place into a warm room and begin playing it, you can expect moisture to condense on the reeds, causing damage. For instance if you were recently playing it outdoors on a cold winter day and you subsequently move into a warm room full of moisture breathing people and start playing it, you will be drawing warm moist air over cold metal reeds. If the temperature of the reeds is below the dew point of the air, moisture will condense on the cold reeds, causing corrosion that will put the reeds out of tune and perhaps damage them irreparably. If your accordion is really cold, bring it inside and leave it closed tightly in its case (sealed away from moisture) for several hours (as long as it takes for it to warm up nearly to room temperature), before you play it. Salt air is corrosive to reeds and other metal parts, so if you play your accordion at the beach or on your saltwater boat, you can expect the reeds and other metal parts to corrode. Never play your accordion in a salt air environment unless you consider the accordion expendable. Moisture is the enemy of wood and leather, so always keep your accordion in a dry place, and never play it in the rain or fog. Never wash your accordion or keyboard in a manner that might allow any liquid to run or drip into it or under the keys, and never spray any liquid on it. The plastic exterior of your accordion and the buttons and keys can be cleaned with a soft cloth slightly dampened in piano key cleaner. If that does not work, dampen the cloth in rubbing alcohol. Never use acetone, lacquer thinner, or other harsh chemicals, as they will attack and dull the plastic finish. Bass straps are anchored to the accordion with light duty rivets not intended to support the weight of the accordion, so never lift your accordion by the bass strap, or the rivets may fail, causing you to drop the accordion and damage it. It\u2019s okay to lift it by the shoulder straps and carry it suitcase-fashion as long as you are careful not to let a strap get under the edge of a key and bend it up. Your accordion should be kept out of its case in a warm dry room, on a bookshelf or table, and unless it has a tone chamber, it should be resting on its feet (the four feet on the bass plate) with a dust cover over it. In this position all the reed leathers are aligned vertically and are thus less likely to sag away from their reed plates. Nearly as good, from the leathers\u2019 point of view, is to keep it in playing position, which at least puts the strong axis of the leathers (the width, rather than the thickness) in opposition to gravity, making them unlikely to sag. The worst position is lying flat with the tops of the keys upward (or downward), because this puts half the leathers in the position where gravity is most likely to cause them to sag away from their reed plates, and they definitely will. If your accordion has a tone chamber, it is best to store it in playing position, as resting it on its feet would put half the leathers in the tone chamber in the position most likely to cause sagging. This may be why Giulietti used to put a handle on one end of its hard cases in addition to the one between the latches. Standing the case on its end puts the accordion into playing position. Keeping your accordion out of its case will contribute to its health and longevity if it encourages you to pick it up and play it more often. However, when you transport your accordion, it should be in its case for better protection against bumps and scratches. Accordion case latches are notorious for coming unlatched at inopportune times, so always carry your hard case with the lid toward your leg so if it pops open the lid will hit your leg, rather than your accordion hitting the pavement. When you transport your accordion by car, the best position is with the case handle up, as this has the accordion resting on its feet, well positioned to tolerate any bumps. However, if you think it might tip over going around a curve or during a sudden start or stop, then it is better to place it with the case lid down, so the treble keys and, most importantly, the bass buttons face downward. This is so that if you hit a big bump the bass buttons won\u2019t all submerge. If the buttons are facing upward and you hit a big bump, the buttons can submerge into their holes and not come back up, requiring a costly repair. Disuse encourages decay. Storing an accordion for long periods subjects it to possible damage from mildew, moths, and corrosion, and allows leathers to sag and curl back from the reed plates. Accordions should be played regularly. Regularly flushing the inside of the accordion with fresh air by playing it discourages mildew, moths, and corrosion. Playing also flexes the leathers and helps keep them soft and flat against the reed plates. Shoulder strap adjustment is essential to proper playing technique and your health and comfort. The left shoulder strap should be several inches shorter than the right. Both straps should be adjusted so the accordion sits well to the left of centre, putting the black treble keys directly below your chin and the top of the accordion about four inches below your chin. In standing position with your right hand on the keyboard, your right wrist straight, your right elbow slightly raised and straight out to your side, and your right shoulder relaxed (not raised and not pulled to the rear), the finger tips of your right hand should just reach the inboard ends of the black keys. If you find yourself playing with your right shoulder pulled back or raised, or with your right elbow down and/or rearward, or with your right wrist bent, then your accordion is probably too far to the right. If you experience fatigue or pain in your right wrist, elbow, or shoulder, your accordion is probably too far to the right. If you position your accordion properly, you will experience less fatigue and be more likely to play often, which will help keep your accordion in good condition. Not all bellows pins are the same size. They may vary in diameter by 1/1000 inch or more, which can make a difference in how they fit, so when you take them out, keep them in order so they will go back into the same holes. If you inadvertently mix them up, make sure you don\u2019t force any of them until you are sure you have the best fit. Forcing the largest pin into the smallest hole may enlarge it, while leaving you with a smaller pin fitting too loosely in the largest hole. Accordions are fragile. If you must ship your accordion, pack it carefully. First immobilize the bass buttons by removing the bass cover and inserting strips of folded cardboard under the bottoms of the pistons to prevent them from moving downward and possibly submerging the buttons. Be sure to advise the recipient on how to remove the cardboard. Wrap the accordion in bubble wrap and put it in its case. Wrap the case in bubble wrap and put it in a tight fitting box. Tape the box well and label it \u201cFragile musical instrument. Do not drop.\u201d If traveling by airline, never check your accordion as baggage. To protect it from damage, put it in a soft case (or no case so people will see and respect its fragility) and make it your carry-on.","title":"Chapter 28. Proper Care"}]}
